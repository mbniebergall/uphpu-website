<p>This presentation will focus on some of the really cool stuff in PHP that you may not know of or not know quite how to
use. There will be examples and discussion regarding abstracts, interfaces, traits, namespaces, and dependency
injection. Have you heard of some of these and always wanted to use them in your PHP application but didn't know where
to start? You will learn the benefit of each one and when to use them in your existing or new application. This will be
a perfect presentation to help you advance your skill-set to include these tools to make your code even more clean,
structured, and awesome!</p>

<h2>The After Party</h2>

<p>The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about 8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Feb. 20th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be me (Justin Carmony) from Deseret Digital Media talking about "Mentoring Devs Into DevOps."¬ù </p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"Lets set aside the buzzword for a moment and have an honest discussion about DevOps. There is the idea of putting more Dev into Ops, but just a crucial (if not more crucial) is getting your Devs to think more like Ops. Most developers have little to no experience dealing with production environments, and helping them add value to your DevOps efforts can be difficult.</p>

<p>"We'll discuss practical ways of mentoring Devs into more DevOps skills and responsibilities. We'll share past experiences &amp; ways to help your Devs gain more insight to the health of production. Ultimately, our goal is to help your Devs gain the skills to help your team achieve better application performance &amp; uptimes. Finally, we'll talk about how Salt can play a major role in increasing insight in your production environment for your Devs."</p>

            <p>Everyone, I can't believe it, but this January will mark 10 years of UPHPU meetings! We're so excited, we're having a little bit of a special meeting for the occasion!</p>

<p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Jan. 16th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It'll be Elizabeth Naramore from GitHub talking about "GitHub: More than Just Code."¬ù We will also me slightly modifying the after party location for this month, so read on for the details.</p>

<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>

<p>"It's no secret that at GitHub, we use GitHub to write the code that runs GitHub. But what you may not know is that we also use GitHub to manage GitHub the company. In this talk, I'll show you practical ways that we use our own system in a non-code context. You'll learn how we track projects and to-do lists, discuss and collaborate on corporate policies, communicate news to a highly distributed company, coordinate events, update and collaborate on internal and external documentation, and even onboard new Hubbers. You'll come away from this talk with a whole new perspective on using GitHub."</p>

<p><strong>About Elizabeth Naramore</strong></p>

<p>Elizabeth is an author, speaker, mentor, and recovering PHP developer. She currently works on the Community Team at GitHub, and loves finding new solutions to old problems.</p>

<p>After Party:  Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn 9:00 PM</p>

<p>For this meeting only, we'll be moving the after party to the Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn in Midvale (details &amp; map: https://www.skiphp.com/mingle/waffle) I also believe that the food will be covered by Jared Smith from Blue Host, who is one of the original members from back in the day. :)</p>

<p><strong>Ski PHP</strong></p>

<p>You've all likely have heard that Utah is having it's first regional PHP conference, Ski PHP! (https://www.skiphp.com/) It is great to see how awesome our community has grown over the last 10 years, and that our user group is one of the oldest PHP user groups today. If you haven't had a chance to sign up to attend, I highly recommend you give it a shot.</p>
