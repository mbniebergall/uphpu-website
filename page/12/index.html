            <p>For our November <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Joseph Brower will be visiting from Idaho to present about scalability platforms. As usual, we'll follow it with our Applebee's aftermeeting. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>As the hype around the "cloud" continues to grow, the importance of understanding how it works becomes more and more relevant.  This presentation will provide an overview of how an application should be designed to ensure that it can scale well.  The presentation will start with an explanation of how some cloud services work followed by things to consider when designing your application to up scale.  We'll finish the presentation (time pending) with a demonstration of a cloud driven work flow and end with a Q/A period.</p>

<p>The presentation will be given with the assumption that the people listening are familiar with PHP development, along with version control systems.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I have a client with 500+ employees-- we have been providing email services for them, but we have permanent white-listing problems on our server. They probably need at least 500 to 1000 email in-boxes with SMTP capability and maybe at least 100 megs of storage. They need a professional business solution (free google apps or plain old gmail are not options).</p>

<p>They have been getting mail through us for years, but its not working well. Our mail flows through an Exim server (WHM), and there's no whitelisting, and I don't think we even use SPF or DKIM. We can set all that up, but I'm not sure it will help. They might just need a 3rd party email service provider.... </p>

<p>I'm thinking of recommending google apps, but I think it's far more than they are willing to spend ($2500 per month unless they offer a volume discount). Fusemail and Fastmail seem to have potential, but I don't know anything about them (it looks like either would cost a few hundred per month or a few thousand per year).</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend a solution here? Setting up a Zimbra or Postfix server are probably not options because we don't have a sysadmin, and I'm too busy writing software for clients to spend time on something like that... I'm basically looking for a cheap, but reliable email service provider...</p>

            <p>For our October <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Grant Shipley, from <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a>, will be flying in from North Carolina to tell us about deploying PHP on ec2 using openshift, and a little about <a href="http://www.follw.it">www.follw.it</a> which is a site he created using Code Igniter, and why I chose PHP over Java for the follw.it site, despite being a Java developer for over 10 years.</p>

<p>Whether you have one or a million visitors accessing your web app, they are all going to demand a great user experience regardless of what it takes for you to deliver it. This invariably means quick page loads and fast response times every single time. When things go south, you just throw more hardware at the problem and increase your caches and buffers, right? Wrong. Toss in an infrastructure that resides on the cloud and now you've got a really interesting problem on your hands. I'll leave the marketecure slides at the door, this is a hands-on technical talk in which we'll deploy an application to the cloud and then turn up the heat by leveraging the right mix of elasticity and auto-sclaing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Grant Shipley is an OpenShift PaaS Evangelist at Red Hat focused on cloud technologies.  Prior to that, Grant was a Manager of Software Development with responsibilities over the www.redhat.com website and supporting infrastructure.  Grant has over 10 years of software development experience focusing on Java and PHP.  In his free time, he contributes to several open source projects including Media Portal and www.follw.it  as well as developing iOS applications.  Grant has been using Linux on a daily basis since 1994 and is active in the FOSS community.</p></blockquote>
