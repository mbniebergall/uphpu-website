        </header>
        <div>
            <p><i>"Spring into PHP5" is a new book from Addison-Wesley's series "Spring into...".  The book is written by Steven Hotzner; an author with many books in his line of credits.  If you are new to PHP5 this might be a great book to check out.</i></p>

<p>I just got a copy of the new book from Steven Holzner entitled "Spring into PHP 5".  The "Spring into" is a new series of books coming from Addison-Wesley publication.  You can check it out at <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/springinto/">Addison-Wesley</a> for more information on additional titles in the series.  First, let me give some back ground on Steven Holzner. I first heard about Steven in the Java programming world. With more than 88 books to his list of publications, he has extensive experience in teaching and software development.</p>

<p>Now lets get into the book.  As with all my reviews the first thing i like to do is check out the table of contents for anything that catches my eye.  Sure enough, there is a couple of chapters that really stood out; chapter 6 Creating Web Forms and Validation User Input and Chapter 7 Object Oriented Programming and File Handling.  As I preceded to read through chapter 6 i noticed that the book has a very, and i mean, very simplistic approach.  The book is written for new PHP users that want to get started with PHP5.  However, as I read through the book I noticed that the book does not cover many of the new features that PHP5 has to offer.  For example, the book does not really have any coverage of interfaces and the new XML features. The book does a great job in covering basic PHP functionality and only devotes chapter 7 to Object Oriented Programming.  </p>

<p>Some of the good items to discuss about the book is that it is simple and provides simple examples for users just learning PHP.  The author does not spend any time focusing on the theory behind PHP and web based programming.  For me this is a negative aspect of the book, but can be a positive aspect for a user just wanting to get down to using PHP with no interest in the workings of PHP.  The examples and very simple and the Steven does a great job explaining the examples in detail for the reader.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel "Spring into PHP5" is a decent book for a new user just starting out with PHP5.  However, with the lack of real PHP5 chapters and the weakness of chapter 7, I think that a new user can find a book that goes into great detail about PHP5 and the new object oriented engine that it contains.  For a user that wants simple examples with a simple and easy to understand layout this book does the trick.</p>

        <div>
            <p><a href="http://www.continue.utah.edu/edtech/">The UofU Continuing Ed. Program</a> offers a wide variety of computer classes, but now there's more than just Word, Excel, and "Internet Essentials". They offer two levels of PHP classes, three levels of Flash (for those of you giving in to the dark side), 2 levels of XHTML, and a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) class. You can even take Visual Basic.Net, heaven forbid, though Javascript seems conspicuously absent. Hold on to your chair though, they're not cheap.</p>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p>Most classes are single day, 9am-5pm courses that cost $189. The PHP classes are each two full days, and cost $495 per class. <a href="http://continue.utah.edu/edtech/fmpro?search_id===EDTEC520&term==1056">Details on PHP Level 1</a> and on <a href="http://continue.utah.edu/edtech/fmpro?search_id===EDTEC521&term==1056">PHP Level 2</a> are available online. The dates are June 14 and 16 (Tuesday &amp; Thursday) for Level 1, and July 5 and 7 (Tuesday &amp; Thursday) for Level 2. The instructor is <a href="http://continue.utah.edu/edtech/fmpro?-format=instructor.html&link===16036343">Nikolai Langlois</a>, who we should probably get involved in UPHPU. (These links seem to be a bit tempermental, but the continuing ed. one seems stable.)</p>

<p>This highlights the demand that exists for training in PHP in our area. It also indicates the value that is placed on it - $1,000 for 32 hours of training puts it at $30/hour. Take off the University overhead, and $20-25/hour of training isn't unreasonable.</p>

<p>Another thing that catches my eye is the fact that they offer only Level 1 and Level 2 classes, with Level 2 stopping with connecting to a database and using PHP sessions and cookies. This is just the tip of the iceberg in  being a good PHP programmer, and I doubt there are many people or organizations in a better position than UPHPU to provide advanced training.</p>

            <p><i>If you are at all interested in Linux, this is one book that you really must have in your library.  It is a book that you atleast need to check out.</i></p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to review a new book in the Bruce Perens' Open Source Series entitled "Linux Quick Fix Notebook"by Peter Harrison. The book is definitely one to have in your library.  The first thing I did when i received the book was open it up to the table of contents and searched out some advanced topics that I have been looking to read. Topics like wireless networks, iptables, and LVMs to name a few.  I was impress to see those topics and more advanced topics like software raids, LDAP and Radius, and linux vpns.  Harrison wrote the book to follow a simple pattern of providing real answers to questions ranging from the most basic to advanced.</p>

<p>One of the first sections of the book that I read was "Expanding Disk Capacity".  In searching the table of contents this was one section that really caught my eye.    My reasoning for selecting this section is two fold: first, I wanted to see if the book could be used as a reference to various topics; and second, because I wanted to check out some of the advanced topics covered in the book.  Peter Harrison does a fanatastic job of focusing on the topic at hand and providing simple and intellegient instruction to your questions.  The flow of the book allows you to pick it up and start with a section and just move through it.</p>

<p>As I started reading the book, I noticed that the progression of the topics moved in an orderly fashion that a system administrator would follow. It allowed the basic administrator to start from the beginning and progress to an advanced level of configuration, security and optimization.  One item that I did not really like is the references to RedHat as the linux distro.  Yet, I can agree with Peter, that many users will start out with this distro or one similar.  I think that the topics are great, and my only regret is that there were not more topics to read about.</p>

<p>The book in its entirety is definitely a must have for any system administrator or software developer.  Mr. Harrison provides valuable information in sizable chunks for the reader to manage.  My only real critique would be to have a different layout in each topic. For example, in chapter 7 Peter discusses "The Linux Boot Process".  He does a great job of explaining and outlining the process. Still, I think that perhaps having sub-sections in the topics would allow readers to glean additional information. Like have a security, advanced, and optimization sub-sections to each topic.</p>

<p>All in all, Harrison does an exceptional job in bring many great topics into one book.  Harrison's style allows the reader to move forward or back without loosing momentum in the book.  The reader can get quick answers to their questions.</p>
