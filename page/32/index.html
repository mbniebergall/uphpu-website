        <div>
            <p><a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a> is a new conference for developers working with open source technologies. It will take place June 17-19 in Portland, OR, with five tracks connecting people across projects, languages and experience to explore how we do our work and why we participate in open source. The conference structure is designed to provide developers with an opportunity to learn from people they might not connect with at other events.</p>

<p>Open Source Bridge is run entirely by volunteers who believe in the need for an open source conference that focuses on the culture of being an open source citizen, regardless of where in the stack you choose to code. All proceeds from conference registration and sponsorship go directly to the costs of the conference.</p>

<p>Sessions and events will share in-depth knowledge about using, creating and contributing to open source as citizens of a greater community. You'll find relevant information whether you write web apps for the cloud, tinker with operating system internals, create hardware, run a startup, or blog about technology. They are still seeking <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/">proposals</a>&mdash;and just extended the deadline to April 10th&mdash;so submit yours before time runs out. Some examples of our proposals so far: Brian Aker on Drizzle, a reboot of MySQL designed "for the cloud"; Linux Kernel hacker Greg K-H about how Linux manages development; Ward Cunningham, inventor of the wiki, about what's next in collaboration; Amber Case, an anthropologist living in both the physical and virtual worlds, about Cyborg Citizenship.</p>

<p>In addition to regular conference sessions, they are holding an unconference day for free-form sessions, and host a 24-hour dedicated "hacker lounge" at the top of the Portland Hilton. In addition to hosting the hacker lounge, the Hilton has offered Open Source Bridge attendees steeply discounted room rates, starting at $139/night.</p>

<p>VisitÂ <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">opensourcebridge.org</a> to learn more about the conference, see our session proposals, and register to attend.</p>

<p>UPHPU members can get $100 off registration with a registration code obtained by contacting <a href="http://uphpu.org/author/mindjuju/">Victor</a> or <a href="http://uphpu.org/author/wade/">Wade</a>. They have also given us one free conference pass to raffle off at our <a href="http://uphpu.org/events/">meeting</a> on 16 April.</p>

            <p>I just set up an @uphpu on twitter. I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thinbegin" target="_self">@thinbegin</a> have really been loving the twitter lately and think it may be a good augmentation to the mailing list, IRC Channel and WordPress tools that are already set up and being used.</p>

<p>If I have stepped on anyone's toes in doing this [setting up the UPHPU twitter user], it was unintentional. I just wanted to grab it up before some other organization out there decided that the acronym fit their needs. :) Please, if there is any stubbed toes by my actions, please email me privately and we'll mend the wound. :)</p>

<p>Of course, any interested twitter users among us should feel free "follow" <a href="http://www.twitter.com/uphpu" target="_self">@uphpu</a>. I really think it would be another great "feed" of communication.</p>

<p>Oh, and feel free to follow me [<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thinbegin" target="_self">@thinbegin</a>] too as I post about PHP, amongst other things, regularly. Micro-blogging FTW!!! :)</p>
