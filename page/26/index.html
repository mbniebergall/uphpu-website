            <p>For our <a href="/events">February meeting</a>, Daniel Crookston will give a mini presentation on sales techniques, Justin Carmony will present on cookies and sessions, and Xmission will give a special presentation on stackable.com.</p>

<p>mainPresentation - Sales 101: The Basics - Daniel Crookston<br />
An overview of a handful of simple sales techniques you can use to schedule more sales calls, win more contracts, and ultimately earn more money.  The skills we'll be focusing on include turning a cold call (whether incoming or outgoing) into an appointment, helping the people you meet with to feel comfortable giving you their business, and negotiating for a better price once they have agreed to purchase your services.</p>

<p>phpFundamentals presentation - Cookies & Sessions in PHP.<br />
For this month's beginners PHP presentation, the topic will be Cookies & Sessions in PHP.   The purpose of Cookies and Sessions and where to implement them into your website. We'll cover how to use them, as well as some common mistakes that new developers can make.<br />
Presented by Justin Carmony</p>

<p>specialPresentation - Stackable.com<br />
Xmission will be coming out to present to us on what stackable.com is and how it works for you.  They will be answering your questions.</p>

<p>About the Main Presenter:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Dan has been programming since he was very young, and programmed professionally for 7 years in PHP.  He realized pretty quickly that sales was going to be a big part of being successful, so he took some sales classes and did a lot of studying.<br />
Recently he took a full time sales position to get more experience in a sales-only environment and to have an opportunity to learn from people who sell full time.

            <p>For our <a href="/events/">January meeting</a>, <a href="http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/">Justin Carmony</a> will cover PHP fundamentals with a presentation on reading the fabulous manual. For a new person to PHP, reading the documentation can be a daunting task. Even worse when you have legions of other developers screaming the acronym "RTFM!" Hopefully we can shed some light on how to get the most out of PHP Documentation, how to search it, how to understand it, and how to get help if the documentation doesn't answer your questions. Justin Carmony will be giving the presentation, and will leave time for questions. You're not alone in learning PHP, let the Utah PHP Usergroup help you.</p>

<blockquote><p>Justin Carmony has worked in web development professionally for the last<br />
five years. With emphasis on PHP, .NET, and Web Services, he has worked on<br />
projects ranging from simple websites to complex communications between<br />
thousands of remote systems. He currently is working as an independent<br />
contractor & private consultant. If you have any questions, comments, or<br />
curiosities you can contact him (justin AT justincarmony DOT com) or read<br />
about his latest endeavors at his blog.</p></blockquote>

<p>Trevor Sharpe will then follow with Basic Linux Server Administration, covering the advanced topic. Many programmers are finding themselves needing to understand and administer linux servers.  This presentation is focused on learning how to effectively use the server through scripts, etc.  Q & A session on admining to follow.</p>

<blockquote><p>Trevor Sharpe is a Systems Administrator for a company in SLC and is also a board member for Utah Open Source.</p></blockquote>

            <p>Being in my seat, I've heard from many people over the course of this past year who have lost / changed employment.  I know there is concern by many who are employed as to what will happen long term. The reality of the matter is this, though.  Recession or no, change happens and the best way to be ready for it is to have a great skill set.  To that end, we are<br />
restructuring the way our meetings will be.</p>

<h4>New Meeting Structure</h4>

<p>We will be splitting our PHP meetings into 2 parts.  First part is basic skills / best practices training.  This is for you new guys who want to learn, but don't know where to start.  This section is called PHP fundamentals and will be hosted by Justin Carmony.  He and I are working on some printed materials and are ramping this up as we speak.  We also have several very senior and tenured members who are VERY friendly to questions. The second portion of our meeting will be a more advanced topic that will be of benefit to intermediate / advanced members, but will still be of great benefit to those who are new.</p>

<h4>Still Social!</h4>

<p>For those interested in the social aspect of our meeting, we still have the famous UPHPU Afterhours party.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<p>As far as learning resources, Ray Hunter and I are working on having books available at our meetings.  While we will have some fun / zany way of handing out the books, there is an understood condition of receiving the book.  You MUST write a review of the book and post it online.  If you don't want to write a review, don't take the book.  I will be breaking arms on this!</p>

<h4>Online Resources</h4>

<p>I know that our recordings have been sporadic.  i'm working on allocating more time to this.</p>
