        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's presentation will be on "Building RESTful API's in Slim Framework" by Noah Goodrich.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM tomorrow (May 15th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a lot of applications being built out for mobile devices or javascript client apps, traditional server side languages and frameworks are becoming more and more often the tools for building web services rather than full stack sites. Slim is a framework that caters specifically to building RESTful web services in PHP.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone tonight!</p>

<h2>Current Venue: Needle.com</h2>

<p>The current venue for the rest of this year at Needle.com. The great thing is it is in the same building complex as last year's venue, C7. Here is the new address (<a href="http://www.needle.com/contact.html">and map if you like</a>):</p>

            <p>This month's presentation will be on "High Performance Websites with Scalable Workers." Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM today <del datetime="2013-06-20T20:35:53+00:00">(May 15th)</del> (ooops, typo. The date is June 20th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>There comes a point in time with a website when eventually need to do something in the background. There are always cron jobs, but eventually those either don't scale well, or are not responsive enough. Learn about how to help your website efficiently scale by using workers. We'll discuss the fundamental theory behind workers and how to easily implement them. We'll learn about several different technologies to help manage workers such as Gearman, Supervisord, Redis, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p>I will be giving the presentation, so I guess I better put a bio here. :P Justin Carmony works for Deseret Digital Media as a Director of Development over DeseretNews.com. He has been working in PHP professionally for over 8 years, and has been attending the UPHPU meetings since 2008.</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month we will be having a presentation from H Hatfield, as well as aÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM tomorrow (April 18th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>H will be presenting on "Scaling From 2 to 6":</p>

<blockquote><p>At some point in any successful web(site|app)'s lifetime, you have to tackle scaling. The first hurdle is having a separate box for your database&mdash;going from 1 box to 2 (This is where a lot of sites start these days). The next hurdle is significantly higher. It involves having load balanced web/app servers, a master and a slave database and a caching server. The focus will be on a traditional LAMP stack, but the principles are fairly universal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since H didn't give me his Bio, I'll give it for him! H is the Director of Development for Deseret Digital Media on the Marketplace team. He oversees many of KSL.com's sites such as KSL Deals, KSL Jobs, KSL Local, Utah.com, and several others. Yes, his whole first name is spelt with a single character, "H", and he is normally sleep deprived with his two twin babies at home. He is also a pretty good guy. :)</p>

<h2>New Venue: Needle.com</h2>

<p>We'd like to thank Vivint for hosting us while we wereÂ in-between venues and new presidents, however we did receive a lot of people asking if we could move it back to the other side of the point of the mountain.
