        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's presentation will be on "High Performance Websites with Scalable Workers." Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM today <del datetime="2013-06-20T20:35:53+00:00">(May 15th)</del> (ooops, typo. The date is June 20th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>There comes a point in time with a website when eventually need to do something in the background. There are always cron jobs, but eventually those either don't scale well, or are not responsive enough. Learn about how to help your website efficiently scale by using workers. We'll discuss the fundamental theory behind workers and how to easily implement them. We'll learn about several different technologies to help manage workers such as Gearman, Supervisord, Redis, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p>I will be giving the presentation, so I guess I better put a bio here. :P Justin Carmony works for Deseret Digital Media as a Director of Development over DeseretNews.com. He has been working in PHP professionally for over 8 years, and has been attending the UPHPU meetings since 2008.</p>

<h2>Current Venue: Needle.com</h2>

<p>The current venue for the rest of this year at Needle.com. The great thing is it is in the same building complex as last year's venue, C7. Here is the new address (<a href="http://www.needle.com/contact.html">and map if you like</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>Needle Inc.<br />
14864 Pony Express Road<br />
Bluffdale, UT 84065</p></blockquote>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month we will be having a presentation from H Hatfield, as well as aÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM tomorrow (April 18th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>H will be presenting on "Scaling From 2 to 6":</p>

<blockquote><p>At some point in any successful web(site|app)'s lifetime, you have to tackle scaling. The first hurdle is having a separate box for your database&mdash;going from 1 box to 2 (This is where a lot of sites start these days). The next hurdle is significantly higher. It involves having load balanced web/app servers, a master and a slave database and a caching server. The focus will be on a traditional LAMP stack, but the principles are fairly universal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since H didn't give me his Bio, I'll give it for him! H is the Director of Development for Deseret Digital Media on the Marketplace team. He oversees many of KSL.com's sites such as KSL Deals, KSL Jobs, KSL Local, Utah.com, and several others. Yes, his whole first name is spelt with a single character, "H", and he is normally sleep deprived with his two twin babies at home. He is also a pretty good guy. :)</p>

<h2>New Venue: Needle.com</h2>

<p>We'd like to thank Vivint for hosting us while we wereÂ in-between venues and new presidents, however we did receive a lot of people asking if we could move it back to the other side of the point of the mountain. We have found the new venue for the rest of the year at Needle.com. The great thing is it is in the same building complex as last year's venue, C7. Here is the new address (<a href="http://www.needle.com/contact.html">and map if you like</a>):</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>We have an excellent presentation for this Thursday's meeting by Russell Ahlstrom: KSS &amp; PHP.</p>

<blockquote><p>KSS is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as SCSS or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).</p>
<p>KSS-PHP is a php library that you can use to turn your KSS documented files into a living styleguide similar to Github's (<a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css">https://github.com/styleguide/css</a>). Styleguides are helpful for maintaining consistency across your sites, getting new developers up to speed, proving out new designs or additions, and ensuring changes or updates to your css don't break existing styles.</p>
<p>Russell is the Director of Web Development for Scan, a Provo based startup that connects the real world with the digital universe in fun and innovative ways. Previous to that, Russell worked as the Director of eCommerce Development at Deseret Digital Media, Senior Developer at Bloosky, Team Lead at BYU's Department of Continuing Education, and as a Web Development instructor at BYU.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our meeting will be held at 7:00PM at the Vinit Office's in Thanksgiving Point, and theÂ after partyÂ will be at Applebee's in Draper as usual. At this meeting we will be discussing venues as well.</p>

<p><strong>Directions To Current Venue: Vivint Offices in Thanksgiving Point</strong></p>

<p>For this meeting we will be meeting at the ThanksgivingÂ Point Vivint Offices, which is just one more exit south than our previous venue. Here is the address:</p>

<p>2500 Executive Pkwy #200, Lehi, Utah 84043</p>

<p>Here is a link in Google Maps:</p>

<p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2500+West+Executive+Parkway+Suite+300,+Lehi,+UT+84043&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.499761,-111.547028&amp;sspn=8.839041,10.579834&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2500+Executive+Pkwy+%23200,+Lehi,+Utah+84043&amp;t=m&amp;z=17">https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2500+West+Executive+Parkway+Suite+300,+Lehi,+UT+84043&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.499761,-111.547028&amp;sspn=8.839041,10.579834&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=2500+Executive+Pkwy+%23200,+Lehi,+Utah+84043&amp;t=m&amp;z=17</a></p>

<p>Here are the directions given by our very own Mac Newbold:</p>

<blockquote><p>Easiest way: get off I-15 at Timpanogos Highway (SR-92) and head west (right if you're coming from Draper, left if you came north through Lehi)</p>
<p>the next light in about a block is Ashton Blvd/Maple Loop - turn left and about 3-4 blocks later, after the in-construction building, there's a road on the left right before the thanksgiving point complex starts,</p>
<p>that's executive parkway</p>
<p>you'll turn left there and we're the building on the left that is finished</p>
<p>come on in, 2nd floor</p></blockquote>

<p>Look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night at 7:00 PM! Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions!</p>
