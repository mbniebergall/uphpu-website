            <p>Last October I had an opportunity to take my consulting company from just a small part time gig to a full time company. The downside is in doing this it moved me to North Carolina. So the reason for this post and how it pertains. I really enjoy being part of this group for the many years that I have been. However I am now attempting to locate groups like this in North Carolina. Anyone have any ideas of good places to look for groups like this in a new area, or even have suggestions on how I could start a similar group to this here in North Carolina?</p>

        <div>
            <p>I've got to admit, i didn't even know there were forks to mysql, but in discussing the matter with Steve Meyers, I can understand better what he means when he says : if you're not using a mysql fork, you have no idea what you're missing out on.</p>

<p>For our <a href="/events">June meeting</a>, Steve will be discussing the benefits of Oracle MySQL, Drizzle, Percona Server, and MariaDB. Don't forget that we're at out new location: <a href="/events">Center 7 in Bluffdale</a>.</p>

<p>A little about Steven:</p>

<blockquote><p>I started out as a developer at Omniture (known as MyComputer.com back then, among other names) from 1998 to 2001.  I was the Chief Architect, involved in all new code and database design. I then worked for MingleMatch (bought by Spark Networks in 2005) from 2001 to 2009.  For a while, I was the entire Development and IT department.  As we hired more employees, I transitioned into a full-time IT management role, while still maintaining a close relationship with the Development group. I left there in 2009, and began working for CrimeReports.com in a similar role.  I left in January 2011 to pursue my own businesses. Since 2001, I have been running CougarBoard.com, a community of BYU sports fans.  I wrote the site from scratch, although it uses a few external libraries.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have become fairly proficient with PHP and MySQL.  My understanding of the system as well as programming side of things has helped me to optimize SQL, PHP, and general web serving.</p></blockquote>
