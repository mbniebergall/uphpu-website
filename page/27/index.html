        </header>
        <div>
            <p>Being in my seat, I've heard from many people over the course of this past year who have lost / changed employment.  I know there is concern by many who are employed as to what will happen long term. The reality of the matter is this, though.  Recession or no, change happens and the best way to be ready for it is to have a great skill set.  To that end, we are<br />
restructuring the way our meetings will be.</p>

<h4>New Meeting Structure</h4>

<p>We will be splitting our PHP meetings into 2 parts.  First part is basic skills / best practices training.  This is for you new guys who want to learn, but don't know where to start.  This section is called PHP fundamentals and will be hosted by Justin Carmony.  He and I are working on some printed materials and are ramping this up as we speak.  We also have several very senior and tenured members who are VERY friendly to questions. The second portion of our meeting will be a more advanced topic that will be of benefit to intermediate / advanced members, but will still be of great benefit to those who are new.</p>

<h4>Still Social!</h4>

<p>For those interested in the social aspect of our meeting, we still have the famous UPHPU Afterhours party.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>

<p>As far as learning resources, Ray Hunter and I are working on having books available at our meetings.  While we will have some fun / zany way of handing out the books, there is an understood condition of receiving the book.  You MUST write a review of the book and post it online.  If you don't want to write a review, don't take the book.  I will be breaking arms on this!</p>

<h4>Online Resources</h4>

<p>I know that our recordings have been sporadic.  i'm working on allocating more time to this.</p>

        <div>
            <p>After much testing, I have concluded that in order to use <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> with boolean attributes (and have it work in the big four browsers), the following markup must be used: checked="checked".</p>

<p>While browsers except any of the following&hellip;</p>

<pre lang="html">
checked
checked=""
checked="true"
checked="1"
checked="checked"
</pre>

<p>&hellip;only the last option works with jQuery in all browsers.</p>

            <p><a href="http://devblog.jasonhuck.com/">Jason Huck's</a> <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-timepicker/">TimePicker plugin</a> didn't work for me as-is since it reads and writes in 12-hour format. While most people (strangely) prefer 12 hour format for interacting with, database time fields are 24 hour. I could have converted the format with scripting on the back-end but decided I would prefer to have the picker display 12-hour but read/write 24-hour. So, I took Jason's great design and rewrote it to suite my needs.</p>

<p>Other changes I made were adding a colon between the hour and the minute select lists, adding a space between the minute and the am/pm list, and changed the hours and minutes arrays such that the hours no longer have leading zeros and the minutes are every five instead of every fifteen.</p>

<p>I have intergrated tomsalfield (issue 3) and jasonalanharris' (issue 5) changes as well.</p>

<p>My version of the script can be found in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-timepicker/issues/detail?id=6">issue tracker</a> on the Google Code project for the plugin. Here's a screenshot of it in use next to a date field:</p>
