            <p>September's <a href="/events">meeting</a> is going to be on PHP and PostgreSQL. Databases play an integral part of what we do as PHP programmers.  Using the right database and schema is critical to scalability and what functionality we can offer our clients.</p>

<p>For this meeting we will have 2 speakers, Joseph Scott and Joshua Tolley.  Joseph will be focusing on using Postgres in a PHP environment.  Joshua will be presenting on "that other open source database". His presentation will cover several interesting and useful PostgreSQL features that make it an excellent choice for situations that would often include MySQL or another database. It will also address common misconceptions about PostgreSQL, as well as some of its deficiencies. Time permitting, the presentation will demonstrate getting started with PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Ray Hunter of Toro Systems will be sponsoring this meeting along with swag from the UTOS conference.  Heck, might even throw in a week long guest pass for Team Fortress 2.</p>

<p>Last but not least, if for nothing else, come join us for the UPHPU afterhours party at Applebees after the meeting.  We usually get there around 8:45 and stay until 1a or so.</p>

            <p>Greets All,</p>

<p> We are postponing our August meeting for one month so that we can focus on the Utah Open Source Conference on August 28 &ndash; 30.  This year's conference topics look really solid with many national and community level speakers including:</p>

<p>-    Paul Frields (Red hat, Inc) - KEYNOTE: Fedora: The Future, First<br />
-   Joe Brockmeier (Novell) - KEYNOTE: How to bootstrap a community<br />
-   Matt Asay (Alfresco) - The Billion Dollar (Free) Software Opportunity<br />
-   Mac Newbold (Code Greene) - Local Keynote: How To Leverage Open Source in a For-Profit Business<br />
-   Jared Smith ( co-author of  O'Reilly's Asterisk: The Future of Telephony) - Dialplans for Dummies: An Introduction to the Asterisk Dialplan<br />
-   Joseph Scott (Automattic) -  WordPress Performance and Scalability</p>

<p>These are literally, just a handful of an awesome lineup of speakers.  Having participated last year and this year, I can tell you Clint Savage and the UTOS foundation spend a lot of time getting this conference up and running right.  I strongly recommend if you have time to attend some or all the days that you take advantage.</p>

<p>The line up can be seen here - http://2008.utosc.com/speaker/list/<br />

            <h2><a href="/blog/2008/07/16/introducing-the-utah-apple-users-group">Introducing the Utah Apple Users Group</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>I am pleased to announce the formation of a new local users group: <a href="http://utahapple.org">The Utah Apple Users Group</a>. We are a group of technophiles that use&mdash;and even cherish&mdash;products designed by Apple in California. We mainly exist simply as a mailing list where we converse and assist each other.</p>

<p>The state currently has two other related user groups&mdash;the <a href="http://mac.byu.edu">BYU Macintosh Users Group</a> and the <a href="http://umug.com">Utah Macintosh Users Group</a>&mdash;but both are affiliated with universities and thus governed by external policies and politics.They are also Macintosh groups, whereas this group covers all things Apple; and, as you are probably aware, Apple has recently expanded it's product line in significant areas other than their Macintosh computer. UMUG also doesn't have a mailing list and their forum has been offline for a long time. So, wether you're a photographer using Aperture, a home theater nut hooking up your Apple TV, an entrepreneur using an iPhone, or a novice with a new iPod, jump on our mailing list and lets chat. We want everyone to feel welcome wether you are a student, a professional, or anyone else.</p>

<p>We do not plan on coordinating any events; we're going to keep this simple. A website will be coming soon with syndicated news and events and we have an IRC channel for chatting in real time. Join the mailing list by sending an email to utahapple-subscribe@utahapple.org.</p>
