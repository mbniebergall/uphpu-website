            <h2><a href="/blog/2008/09/25/400">Ryan Stewart from Adobe on AMF and Flex</a></h2>

        <div>
            <p>For our October <a href="/events/">meeting</a>, Ryan Stewart, a technical evangelist with Adobe will present on AMF and Flex. Rich Internet applications (RIAs) are everywhere. With Web businesses like Google and Yahoo! and brick and mortar companies like Harley Davidson and Sherwin Williams embracing RIAs for their online presence, the media buzz is giving way to the reality of a better Internet.</p>

<p>Adobe has recently contributed AMF support to the Zend Framework, allowing PHP developers to easily build Rich Internet Applications using Flex and Adobe AIR that interact with a PHP backend.</p>

<p> <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?page_id=2<br />
 ">Ryan</a> will give an introduction to Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR, and will walk through how to create a Flex application powered by PHP and the Zend Framework. Working with Zend Studio for Eclipse, and Flex Builder (an Eclipse plugin), Ryan will demonstrate how to build, debug and deploy applications built with Adobe Flex, and how to have these same applications run on the desktop using the Adobe AIR runtime.</p>

<p>With this knowledge, developers will be able to easily build rich Internet applications that combine data from PHP and rich media like audio and video into a compelling application.</p>

            <p>September's <a href="/events">meeting</a> is going to be on PHP and PostgreSQL. Databases play an integral part of what we do as PHP programmers.  Using the right database and schema is critical to scalability and what functionality we can offer our clients.</p>

<p>For this meeting we will have 2 speakers, Joseph Scott and Joshua Tolley.  Joseph will be focusing on using Postgres in a PHP environment.  Joshua will be presenting on "that other open source database". His presentation will cover several interesting and useful PostgreSQL features that make it an excellent choice for situations that would often include MySQL or another database. It will also address common misconceptions about PostgreSQL, as well as some of its deficiencies. Time permitting, the presentation will demonstrate getting started with PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Ray Hunter of Toro Systems will be sponsoring this meeting along with swag from the UTOS conference.  Heck, might even throw in a week long guest pass for Team Fortress 2.</p>

<p>Last but not least, if for nothing else, come join us for the UPHPU afterhours party at Applebees after the meeting.  We usually get there around 8:45 and stay until 1a or so.</p>

            <p>Greets All,</p>

<p> We are postponing our August meeting for one month so that we can focus on the Utah Open Source Conference on August 28 &ndash; 30.  This year's conference topics look really solid with many national and community level speakers including:</p>

<p>-    Paul Frields (Red hat, Inc) - KEYNOTE: Fedora: The Future, First<br />
-   Joe Brockmeier (Novell) - KEYNOTE: How to bootstrap a community<br />
-   Matt Asay (Alfresco) - The Billion Dollar (Free) Software Opportunity<br />
-   Mac Newbold (Code Greene) - Local Keynote: How To Leverage Open Source in a For-Profit Business<br />
-   Jared Smith ( co-author of  O'Reilly's Asterisk: The Future of Telephony) - Dialplans for Dummies: An Introduction to the Asterisk Dialplan<br />
-   Joseph Scott (Automattic) -  WordPress Performance and Scalability</p>

<p>These are literally, just a handful of an awesome lineup of speakers.  Having participated last year and this year, I can tell you Clint Savage and the UTOS foundation spend a lot of time getting this conference up and running right.  I strongly recommend if you have time to attend some or all the days that you take advantage.</p>

<p>The line up can be seen here - http://2008.utosc.com/speaker/list/<br />
