            <p>Come learn about abstracts, interfaces, traits, namespaces, and dependency
injection. Have you heard of some of these and always wanted to use them in your PHP application but didn&#039;t know
where to start? You will learn the benefit of each one and when to use them in your existing or new application.

            <p>For our November meeting, <a href="http://novapages.com">Velda Harper Christensen</a> will present on fundamental concepts that won't replace your designer, but will help bridge the gap between logic and aesthetics. Velda is a designer, blogger, mother, geek, and full-time student. As usually, after hours party to follow!</p>

<p>We are also running a tech book drive to assist those who are just starting to learn web programming!  You and I both know you're not using those HTML books anymore!  bring them in and let somebody else benefit from something collecting dust on your shelf! Bring in what you can, HTML, JavaScript, etc,  I promise it'll go to good use.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2009/10/26/sams-teach-yourself-php-mysql-and-apache-by-julie-melonie">Sams Teach Yourself PHP, MySQL, and Apache by Julie Melonie</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p>As you can guess from the title, this book is a primer geared towards beginning AMP developers. I've probably read half a dozen books like this over the last year, and this is one of the best I've seen. </p>

<p>Melonie is the Technical Director at i2i Interactive in Los Altos, Callifornia, and has written 8 books on web development topics, mostly centered around PHP and MySQL. This book assumes no previous knowledge of PHP or MySQL. The only real requirement is a working knowledge of HTML. Melonie explains the material in a clear, non-intimidating fashion which makes it truly accessible to anyone. She does a good job of explaining concepts that are often difficult for new programmers (such as objects), and gives plenty of examples to illustrate. </p>

<p>One thing that's missing from a lot of other introductory books is the Apache piece. I like that this book dedicates some time to Apache besides just the usual cursory overview of how to install it. Melonie explains what you need to know about the Apache configuration file, and covers some useful topics like implementing virtual hosting and setting up a secure web server.</p>

<p>Final word: I can definitely recommend this book as a good starter for anyone wanting to get their feet wet in AMP development. It could probably even serve as a refresher for more experienced developers, or a reference for anyone. </p>

        <div>
            <p>I have created a Google Group for us so that you may "wave" to everyone in the group via Google Wave. Unfortunately, we didn't get a pretty URL or email address because they were already used and Google has a lame rule that they can only be used once, even if the previous instance has been deleted (which was by me, which makes it even more lame).</p>

<p>Visit the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp">Google Group home page</a> for more information. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/utahphp/subscribe">Join the group</a> and then add the address "utahphp@googlegroups.com" to your Google Contacts list. You can then add the group address to new waves and everyone will have access to it.</p>

<p>Note that Wave will bark that that user does not have a valid Wave account when you try to add it. Ignore that and simply strike the return key and the address will be added to your contact list.</p>
