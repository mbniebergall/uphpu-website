<p>p><i>Ok, I know this isn't technically a PHP book.  However, Ray was gracious enough to get me this book for review, and I believe the book offers techniques and advice to just about any programmer, not just for C++.</i></p>

<p>Practical C++ Programming, like most O'Reilly books, is a top-notch technical book, with a focus on beginning programmers, but with enough readability to serve more experienced C++ coders.  Steve Oualline does a great job of mixing technical, aesthetic, and design advice, spattered with small, amusing anecdotes and miniature quizzes.  He uses examples effectively to reinforce standard programming concepts and gently nudge the reader along the sometimes painful path of C++.</p>

<p>The best aspect of the book isn't the technical knowledge passed along by Oualline;  it's the more abstract things he tackles that truly separate it from other C++ books, such as object orientated and procedural design practice, styling and naming conventions, and the tools of programming that many books miss: Makefiles and a brief overview of debugging utilities.  It's refreshing to read a book that takes such points into account, and I found myself nodding in agreement in these sections.</p>

<p>As far as technical material, Oualline keeps up-to-date by including sections on fairly new and complex topics such as namespaces, STL, and templates, without alienating the reader.  He uses code often to explain various points, keeping most examples small,  but building to larger snippets and build on previous chapters smoothly.   The 'C to C++' chapter in particular was excellent, and I think even C++ programmers could benefit from a quick overview of this section.</p>

<p>All in all, Practical C++ is an excellent book as a supplement to your generic C++ reference book, especially for those new to C++ programming or just coding in general.   However, I think many, more experienced, programmers could also benefit from his gems of wisdom on various topics that he sprinkles throughout the book.  I've come to expect the best from O'Reilly, and, again, I wasn't disappointed.  </p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2005/04/24/the-zen-of-css-design-peach-pit">The Zen of CSS Design</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><img style="margin: 0 0 15px 15px" id="image292" src="http://uphpu.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/images.jpg" alt="images.jpg" align="right" />I just finished reading <a href="http://www.peachpit.com/title/0321303474">Zen of CSS Design, The: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</a> by <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/about/dave/">Dave Shea</a> and <a href="http://molly.com/about.php">Molly E. Holzschlag</a>. For those that don't recognize the name,  Dave Shea is the "creator and cultivator of the highly influential <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a>." The book is well-written, interesting, and covers the subject well.</p>

<p>The way in which the book covers web design is both different and interesting. Instead of simply mechanically moving through lessons, the auther covers web design standards, principles, and techniqueï¿½ by using the conceptualization, birth, and life of the website CSS Zen Garden as a perpectual example. The result provides for interesting reading and for an excellent real-world example experience.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes this book different from many web development books is that it spends more time covering design theory than technical application. This to me is exciting, because even though it was very elementary to me personally, we always need to be reminded about the fundamental principles of design. This book will be of most value however to those just beginning their education in web design or those with a more technical background seeking to improveï¿½or at least enhance their understanding or appreachiation ofï¿½good design.</p>

<p>What I found most interesting about the book was the history of Shea and his adventure with CSS Zen Garden. He descripes this interests with web design, web standards, and making a statement. It was interesting to follow the detailed process of organizing his efforts, putting the project together, and partaking of an insiders view of something that has been such a high profile event.</p>

<p>All-in-all, the book is a good read. It was quick, but effective. I did find the last half of the book to be a little repetative, but that might have been because the principles were already understood. Advanced CSS masters will find little value in the book technically, but the history of the web described in the biginning chapters and the story of the Zen Garden makes it still a worthwhile read. Novices and others looking to increase their knowledge of CSS and general web layout however, will be findï¿½ a collection of lessons and tutorials pulled from real page examples hosted online in the garden archives.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed, but that is only because I was hoping to learn something new and not because the book was lacking. It was simply because the book is for a more entry-level audienceï¿½and for that it achieves it's purpose well.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/2005/04/22/php-training-classes-and-group-project-coming-soon">PHP training classes and group project coming soon</a></h2>
        </header>
        <div>
            <p><em><b>Attention: If you're interested in the training classes and/or the group project, read this and respond appropriately!</b></em></p>

<p>The plan is moving forward, and we're working out the logistical details of getting the course off the ground.There are a couple of important discussion threads on the mailing list, and a poll to plan days of the week, measure interest and estimate attendance. We are in urgent need of some feedback from people, whether they're interested in training, the group project, or both.</p>

<p><b><em>If you're interested in participating in the training courses:</em></b></p>

<p><b>1. We need to you to take the poll, so we can decide on a day.</b> For now, don't worry about cost, location, or anything like that, and just assume we'll be able to work things out with you.</p>

<p><b>2. "Pre-register" with Wade or myself, the sooner the better.</b> We need to get together a list of interested people so we can email the smaller group and expect to get answers back in a timely fashion. Without being able to contact everyone, it will be really hard to make this work.</p>

<p><b><em>If you're not interested in training, but would like to participate in the group project:</em></b></p>

<p><b>1. Some of the group project meetings will coincide with training meetings.</b> For example, the first half of a training meeting may be discussion and planning for the group project, while the second half would be training related to the plans that were made.</p>

<p><b>2. Take the poll, and select your day(s) of choice.</b> The team working on the project has to have time to get together, and we need to know when you can make it.</p>

<p><b>3. Tell Wade or myself that you're interested in the project but not training classes.</b> If you'd like to also specify what level or kind of involvement you'd like to have, that might help too. We'll probably set up a developer mailing list for the project along with CVS or subversion accounts and access to a MySQL database for all the team members.</p>

<p>We really want to know what people want to do, and where UPHPU should be focusing to provide the most benefits to its members and our community. Without some participation from other people, it will end up being based on the ideas of just a few of us, and probably won't be as good.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for your participation in UPHPU!</p>
