        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's presentation will be a presentation on Single Page Applications &amp; Javascript MVVM Frameworks by Mac Newbold.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be September 19th at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Talk summary: </p>

<blockquote><p>
For many years, we've been building web applications in more or less the same way. The tools have changed, but the architecture has mostly remained the same. Single page applications are a newer approach that can simplify your development and provide a better user experience, especially for mobile devices. This talk discusses what single page apps are, how you build one, and lessons learned in a team that has built several in a variety of different ways. We will also discuss the role that Javascript MVVM frameworks can play in Single Page Applications.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mac Newbold has been involved in the Utah Open Source scene for a very long time, and previously was our Utah PHP Usergroup President. He currently is a Principle Developer at Vivint. To be honest, he is a pretty darn smart guy and always gives a good presentation. :) </p>

<p>See you there!</p>

        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's meeting on August 15th will be a slightly different format. Instead of a traditional presentation, we will be having an open discussion night with the theme: "Show &amp; Tell your Favorite Tools for PHP."</p>

<p>It will be an open discussion with a little structure of people showing some of their favorite tools they use while working with PHP. Whether it is a PHP Library, Editor, Debugger, or even favorite git command, it'll be a chance to see what people find useful while working with PHP. So if you have anything interesting to share, please feel free to show it off and talk just a little bit about why it is awesome.</p>

<p>There will be free pizza like usual, and we're hoping that everyone will be able to walk away with a slightly fuller brain and stomach. :)</p>

            <p>This month's presentation will be an introduction to the Kohana Framework by Will Smith.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be July 18th at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Be cause Will is a man of many words, he gave me this very lengthy summary of his talk:</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>Kohana is a lightweight open source PHP5 framework that is easy to learn and very flexible. In this presentation we will introduce key concepts.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bio he sent was every more lengthy!</p>

<blockquote><p>Will Smith: Utah native. Family man. Mortician. SysAdmin. Open Source advocate.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'll see if you can notice which one of those credentials is not like the other. :P But Will is an excellent speaker who is very fun to listen to. He has served on the Utah Open Source Foundation's Core Team and Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there at the meeting!</p>
