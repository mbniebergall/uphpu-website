        </header>
        <div>
            <p>This month's meeting on August 15th will be a slightly different format. Instead of a traditional presentation, we will be having an open discussion night with the theme: "Show &amp; Tell your Favorite Tools for PHP."</p>

<p>It will be an open discussion with a little structure of people showing some of their favorite tools they use while working with PHP. Whether it is a PHP Library, Editor, Debugger, or even favorite git command, it'll be a chance to see what people find useful while working with PHP. So if you have anything interesting to share, please feel free to show it off and talk just a little bit about why it is awesome.</p>

<p>There will be free pizza like usual, and we're hoping that everyone will be able to walk away with a slightly fuller brain and stomach. :)</p>

        <div>
            <p>This month's presentation will be an introduction to the Kohana Framework by Will Smith.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be July 18th at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Be cause Will is a man of many words, he gave me this very lengthy summary of his talk:</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>Kohana is a lightweight open source PHP5 framework that is easy to learn and very flexible. In this presentation we will introduce key concepts.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bio he sent was every more lengthy!</p>

<blockquote><p>Will Smith: Utah native. Family man. Mortician. SysAdmin. Open Source advocate.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'll see if you can notice which one of those credentials is not like the other. :P But Will is an excellent speaker who is very fun to listen to. He has served on the Utah Open Source Foundation's Core Team and Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there at the meeting!</p>

            <p>This month's presentation will be on "Building RESTful API's in Slim Framework" by Noah Goodrich.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM tomorrow (May 15th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>With a lot of applications being built out for mobile devices or javascript client apps, traditional server side languages and frameworks are becoming more and more often the tools for building web services rather than full stack sites. Slim is a framework that caters specifically to building RESTful web services in PHP.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone tonight!</p>
