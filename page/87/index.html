        </header>
        <div>
            <p>To cut to the chase, I heartily recommend this book. Any serious web server admin should have a copy of this book -- I've found it indispensable, and refer to it often. They're not exaggerating when they call it "The Definitive Guide"</p>

<p>Billed as, "Vital information for Apache Programmers and administrators," this book is definitely geared toward that audience -- programmers and admins. That said, the first chapter, "Getting Started," provides an excellent overview of basic web server concepts that most newbies could understand.</p>

<p><b>What I liked</b><br />I liked almost everything! I found the first half of the book (chapters 1-12) the most useful. These chapters covered just about everything you'd want to know about configuring and running apache. Beyond just the basics, the book covers in depth: virtual hosts, authentication, content description and modification, indexing, redirection, proxying, logging, security, and running a big web site. I came away with a much higher level of respect for Apache's capabilities -- I was really surprised how much I didn't know about Apache, and how much this book could tell me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there was a very interesting section on writing modules for Apache which, though a little beyond my expertise, gave me a better understanding of Apache's inner workings.</p>

<p><b>Disappointments</b><br />My biggest disappointment with the book was that it dealt so little with PHP, which only got 6 pages. I would have been less disappointed if they hadn't 50-plus pages to CGI/Perl and 17 pages to Java. Additionally, their XML section dealt almost entirely with Perl and Java, ignoring PHP. Granted, this isn't a PHP-specific book, but (considering I got the book via a PHP user group) I hoped for equal coverage.</p>

            <p>Well, the sun has really shined on use this past week. First, I would like to sincerelly thank each member that donated towards our new server fund! Your support is very much apprecaited by all. We have been very blessed.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce to everyone that yesterday morning a group member's company responded to our plea and offered to sponsor us. They will be covering the rest of our needs for the new server. They will also be providing bandwidth and rack space.</p>

<p>Although the server is now taken care off, I would still like to encourage everyone to donate, as we still have some expenses and we would also like some funds to use for refreshments, activities, speakers for presentations and so forth.</p>

<p>Please take a minute to visit <a href="http://hostinginferno.com">Hosting Inferno</a> and thank them for their support. Please recommend them when consulting with clients.</p>

<p>So, thanks to all and we should be on the new server shortly. Enjoy your Thursday.</p>

            <p>The Utah PHP Users Group is run and supported entirely by volunteers. This incredible resource and service is ours because of the generosity of every member's time and talents. These services include support from local businesses and corporations, locations for our monthly meetings, donations from publishers, and our web resources (bandwidth and hosting).</p>

<p>As we have just recently passed our one year anniversary, it is a good time for reflection on what we have accomplished and how we have grown. We are now 150 members strong. I would take the opportunity to thank everyone that has given to the group so selflessly and generously. We are fast becoming the definitive resource in Utah for both developers and employers, in resource of knowledge and skill, camaraderie, and support of standards-based and developing technologies. I hope that we may continue to grow and continue to become increase our recognition and respect for this.</p>

<p>I also approach you with some requests. The success of our group is directly proportional to what each of us put into it. We are continually seeking for additional assistance from local companies and organizations for support. We need more volunteers to present and host activities. We would like to establish additional relationships with sponsors and technology firms.</p>

<p>We are also needing to upgrade our server. The wind has carried rumors of us upgrading our mailing list for some time now and it is time to take action on this need. Our website is currently hosted on a virtual account with the mail and mailing list(s) on a separate server. I would like to move everything to a collocated server where we may have a home that is entirely ours. There, we will also be able to finally make the upgrade to mailman, that we have all dreamed of for so long. I will continue to supply the hosting and bandwidth, but will need some assistance for the purchase of the hardware.</p>

<p>If you are interested in assisting an anyway, wether it be time, talents, or resources, you may do so by contacting <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/users.php?mode=profile&uid=43">Dave</a>, our volunteer in charge of activities.</p>

<p>You may donate financially through <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20040520232950120">PayPal</a> or in person at any of our activities. If only fifty of us donate five dollars each, we would have $250 to put towards a new server.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support! We are glad you are part of the group. Please let us know what things your find useful and feel free to submit any suggestions or ideas.</p>
