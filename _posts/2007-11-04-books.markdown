<h3>Library</h3>
<p>The UPHPU has a library full of reference and training manuals on subjects relating to and/or about PHP, MySQL, Linux, Apache, and many other topics. Members may <a href="/books/library/">check out</a> any of our titles free of charge.</p>
<h3>Free books</h3>
<p>We have established relationships with many large publishers to provide books for your convenience. We often receive new titles as gifts that are given away at our meetings as door prizes. The only stipulations is that the recipient write a brief review of the book that we return to the publisher. You may also request any title to be sent to you for a review. Contact Ray Hunter, our librarian, to request a title.</p>
<h3>Reviews</h3>
<p>Read <a href="/category/reviews/">reviews</a> on books in our library and other manuals, books, articles, and publications.</p>
<h3>Publisher discounts</h3>
<p>Members have access to special discounted prices from publishers. See our <a href="/books/publishers/">publishers</a> page for a list of participating publishers, contact information, and their discount code.</p>
