<p>After asking some questions about branching and merging best practices, Levi with the <a href="http://plug.org/">Provo Linix Users Group</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/bestpractices.html">High-level Best Practices in Software Configuration Management</a> by <a href="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce Software</a>. It is indeed high-level, but contained good information.</p>
