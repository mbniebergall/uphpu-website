<p>A new security magazine called <a href="http://insecuremag.com/">[in]secure</a> has just come out with their <a href="http://www.insecuremagazine.com/INSECURE-Mag-2.pdf">second issue</a> which includes a pretty good look at PHP vulnerability containment within a shared server space (page 26).  Has some good examples and is a good overview-type read.</p>
