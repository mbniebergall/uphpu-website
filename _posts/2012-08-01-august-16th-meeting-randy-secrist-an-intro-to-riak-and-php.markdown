<p>Here are the details on our next meeting:</p>
<p>Title: An Intro to Riak and PHP<br />
Presenter: Randy Secrist </p>
<p>This talk will be an introduction to Riak, an open source, scalable database, and how to interact with it from various client libraries, with a focus on PHP.  Attendees will learn the basic architecture of Riak, why companies like Voxer, Comcast, and BestBuy trust it in production, and also get some hands-on experience with running the database on their own machines.</p>
<p>The usual details apply: 3rd Thursday (Aug. 16th) 7:00pm at C7 Bluffdale Datacenter, with afterparty at Draper Applebee's (12300 South, just east of I-15)</p>
