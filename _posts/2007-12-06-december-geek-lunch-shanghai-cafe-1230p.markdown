<p>Greets UPHPU!</p>
<p>In addition to the Geek Lunch scheduled this Friday (info below), Iâ€™ve just been contacted by <a href="http://macnewbold.com/">Mac Newbold</a> of <a href="http://codegreene.com">Code Greene</a> about a PHP community event they are hosting!</p>
<p>Called the Lunch-and-Learn, Code Greene offers a lunch and then a presents a topic.  This week theyâ€™ve kindly synchronized with our Geek Lunch so that after the UPHPU event, you can go back to their place for a lesson!</p>
<p>This weekâ€™s lesson is being taught by the Code Greene design team to talk about Graphic Design.</p>
<p>The location for presentation is:</p>
