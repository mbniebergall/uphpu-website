<p>September's <a href="/events">meeting</a> is going to be on PHP and PostgreSQL. Databases play an integral part of what we do as PHP programmers.  Using the right database and schema is critical to scalability and what functionality we can offer our clients.</p>
<p>For this meeting we will have 2 speakers, Joseph Scott and Joshua Tolley.  Joseph will be focusing on using Postgres in a PHP environment.  Joshua will be presenting on "that other open source database". His presentation will cover several interesting and useful PostgreSQL features that make it an excellent choice for situations that would often include MySQL or another database. It will also address common misconceptions about PostgreSQL, as well as some of its deficiencies. Time permitting, the presentation will demonstrate getting started with PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Ray Hunter of Toro Systems will be sponsoring this meeting along with swag from the UTOS conference.  Heck, might even throw in a week long guest pass for Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>Last but not least, if for nothing else, come join us for the UPHPU afterhours party at Applebees after the meeting.  We usually get there around 8:45 and stay until 1a or so.</p>
