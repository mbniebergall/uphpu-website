<p>I am excited to announce the launch of the <a href="http://ugaf.org">Utah Graphic Artists Forum</a>. For years I have longed for a place where I could interactive with and meet new local artists. Having participated in many technical groups, I have grown to rely on and take for granted both the camaraderie and invaluable resource of information that such communities provide. Often frustrated by the lack of an official forum for art related questions however, I vowed to someday create the resource I longed for.</p>
<p>Officially launching tomorrow, I present the Utah Graphic Artists Forum, a gathering place for local graphic artists. My purpose is to promote and support the development and expression of graphic arts and to facilitating and ecouraging conversations and interaction between graphic artists in Utah, in an environment free of dues or obligations. I hope to provide something of value to members involved in all forms of the graphic arts, including illustrators, photographers, graphic designers, typographers, user interface designers, and web developers.</p>
<p>Both working professionals and students are welcome and encouraged to participate, discussing current events and trends, historical topics, theory, techniques, technology, business, and/or employment.</p>
<p>Features include a forum, mailing lists, an IRC channel for chat, job announcements, RSS feeds, syndicated calendar events, and plans to meet periodically for socials and workshops. Membership is free and open to anyone interested.</p>
<p>I encourage you to visit the site, register an account, and participate in the forum.</p>
