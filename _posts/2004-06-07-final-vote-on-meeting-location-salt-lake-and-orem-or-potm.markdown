<p>Thanks to everyone that has been involved in our quest to find the most convenient meeting location and schedule. A lot of footwork and strenuous thinking has been be exerted in an attempt find the best solution.</p>
<p>In addition to the work that David is doing to secure a location for our June meeting, we are also looking for a possible permanent SL valley location, as part of the options we are investigating. We know that it is impossible for us to pamper every member, but we would like to try.</p>
<p>It is time, however, to bring this issue to a close. So, we have narrowed down our decision to two options...</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>One meeting per month, held at the Point of the Mountain</li>
<li>Two meetings per month, one held in the middle of Salt Lake Valley and the other held in the middle of Utah Valley (Orem)</li>
</ol>
<p>...one of which will be implemented by our July meeting.</p>
<p>Because of the increase in membership of individuals that live North of the Point of the Mountain, it was decided at our May meeting that we would 'test the waters' and hold this month's meeting further North.</p>
<p>Things have continued to progress since then though and in addition to this information, feedback from the poll we took a little while back, and additional increases in membership the past few weeks (we are 61 registered members strong now with 81 on the mailing list) we are leaning more and more towards the idea that two meetings, one in each valley (Salt Lake and Utah), will offer the best opportunities for attendance from the group. The only foreseeable drawbacks are having to find two presenters every thirty days. It will be well worth our time and efforts however if we have enough interest and participation.</p>
<p>So, please cast your vote and if you have any connections to a location that is very near I-15 and in the middle of Salt Lake Valley, please send a note to our Events Manager, <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/users.php?mode=profile&uid=43">Dave Turnbull</a>.</p>
