<p>We are happy to report that the <a href="http://uphpu.org/staticpages/index.php?page=20040521003849494">archives</a> are now searchable. Using an implementation of <a href="http://google.com">Google's</a> site-only search we found on <a href="http://plug.org">PLUG</a>'s website for inspiration, we have implemented search fields on the mailing list page that allow you to search Google's cache of the  archives. A neat benefit to this search is that it is narrowed to each list's archives only, keeping results completely relevant.</p>
