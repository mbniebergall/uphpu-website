<p>This month's presentation will be on "High Performance Websites with Scalable Workers." Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM today <del datetime="2013-06-20T20:35:53+00:00">(May 15th)</del> (ooops, typo. The date is June 20th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>
<blockquote><p>There comes a point in time with a website when eventually need to do something in the background. There are always cron jobs, but eventually those either don't scale well, or are not responsive enough. Learn about how to help your website efficiently scale by using workers. We'll discuss the fundamental theory behind workers and how to easily implement them. We'll learn about several different technologies to help manage workers such as Gearman, Supervisord, Redis, and others.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will be giving the presentation, so I guess I better put a bio here. :P Justin Carmony works for Deseret Digital Media as a Director of Development over DeseretNews.com. He has been working in PHP professionally for over 8 years, and has been attending the UPHPU meetings since 2008.</p>
