<p>Thanks to John Anderson and Dan Fellars for a great meeting last night, and to everyone who attended. It was great to get to know Lithium better.</p>
<p>Last night we had a special surprise, as well. Justin Carmony was in contact with Chris Hartjes, author of "The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications", who donated a free copy of the book to a lucky UPHPU member. I'm pleased to announce that shuffle() selected Clint Berry! You can learn more about Chris and the book at <a href="http://www.grumpy-testing.com/">http://www.grumpy-testing.com/</a> or <a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard">http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard</a> or follow Chris on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/grmpyprogrammer">@grmpyprogrammer</a>. Thanks again, Chris!</p>
