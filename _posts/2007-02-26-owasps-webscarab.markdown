<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project">WebScarab</a> for a while now, and thought I'd share it with those who aren't familiar with it.Â  It's a web security analysis application written in Java.Â  It has numerous included plug-ins with the standard install, including a spider, parameter fuzzer, session analyzer, HTTP/HTTPS interception/mangling, and much more.Â  OWASP once again proves their skill in creating a extremely useful tool.Â  Check it out!</p>
