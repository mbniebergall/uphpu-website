<p>I'm a student at BYU right now and a friend and I have come up with an idea for a website that we think could go really far.  We've been struggling to find people skilled enough who are willing to give it a try with us though.  One of my friends suggested that I ask on here and see if anyone is up to it.  We would only be able to offer a percentage of any future profits instead of a set pay, but there is no guarantee of anything since it's just an idea right now...  Anyway, let me know if you want to join in.  Or if I'm even posting this in the right place...</p>
