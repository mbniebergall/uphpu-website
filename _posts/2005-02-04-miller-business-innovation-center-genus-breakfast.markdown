<p>A monthly breakfast, started by Matt Asay, the Director of the Linux Business Office at  Novell/SuSE, is being held for anyone that wants to meet other Utah entrepreneurs, or potential investors. These breakfasts draw a wide range of entrepreneurs, from many disciplines, along with potential angle and VC investors. For someone thinking of doing their first, or next, start-up it is a place to meet others doing the same thing- from experienced and successful entrepreneurs to the graphic designers, accountants and sales people that can assist. Matt created this event to get more entrepreneurs in Utah networking with each other.<br />
Their information follows:</p>
<p>Join us on Friday, February 4 at 8:00 a.m., for light refreshments and networking. Bring yourself, bring a friend, bring your boss, bring five dollars   we'll provide the rest, no reservation required.</p>
<p>There are a few changes to the 2005 breakfast series:  this year, we're moving up from the 2nd floor of the Center to the 3rd floor.  Also, we're offering participants a posting board.  Bring materials to post including employment opportunities, service provider information, capital resources needed, etc. etc.  Creativity is encouraged!</p>
<p>If you are interested in giving a 2-minute "elevator pitch" to promote your business, please respond to this e-mail with the phrase "Elevator Pitch" in the subject line and include your telephone number so that we may contact you. </p>
<p>Note to genus breakfast newbies:<br />
The genus venture breakfasts are intended to bring together the people that make up a successful startup, from entrepreneur to VC to recruiter to accountant to government official, and anyone else I may be leaving out.  You were likely referred by someone already in attendance, or you attended another event sponsored by the hosts at Miller Business Innovation Center.  Unlike other events staged by UITA, Mountain West Venture Group, T2M, etc. (all of which are great, and deserve your attention), we're focusing on making these gatherings informal, speaker-less, and inclusive.  The purpose is to create a regular forum for people in Utah's venture community to meet, swap ideas, and hopefully make a billion dollars.  No Ponzi schemes.  No Amway.  Just a breeding ground for good ideas, good connections, and good business.</p>
