<p>I am pleased to announce that the job announcement form on the website no longer requires the user to be logged in. This is significant as most people posting job announcements are managers, human resources staff, or recruiters and therefor have no reason to have an account. If you are someone that only created an account to post a job, please send me a note so that we can remove your profile.</p>
