<p>I recently picked up a copy of the "<a href="http://www.phparch.com/shop_product.php?itemid=135">ZEND PHP 5 Certification Study Guide</a>" by <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a>.  I have not yet finished it, however thus far I have liked it enough to want to tell other people about it.</p>
<p>The book is around 250 pages long (short by most standards).  To this point I have found that this book is a good way to brush up on things I already knew and learn some things that I did not.  I am personally using the book to help me study for the <a href="http://www.zend.com/education/zend_php_certification">PHP 5 certification</a>.  However, certification or not, it is turning out to be an excellent tool for honing my skills.  It has the added benefit of showing me areas that I need to work on as well as indicating to myself how much about PHP I really know.</p>
<p>I would recommend this book to the PHP programmer of any level.</p>
