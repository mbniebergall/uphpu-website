<p>As you've probably recently heard, our great and fearless leader Victor 'mindjuju' Villa has made some changes, and our previous venue will no longer be available, on top of which he has passed his UPHPU baton to me.</p>
<p>While it is definitely not a requirement that the meetings be held at the place of employment of the current president, that tradition will continue for the foreseeable future, as he new <a href="/events">meeting location</a> is my place of employment. We're the one with the big green stripe on the front window and door. Note that you can get to us via southbound State Street at 350 S onto Exchange Place, or via westbound 400 South at about 30 E, onto Cactus Street. Many of you may be familiar with XMission, and we're right across the back alley from them. Also important to note is that parking on the street at meters is free after 6pm, and parking in the garage across the street will cost $5 for the evening, and we will be unable to validate. We will continue to meet at seven o'clock on the evening of the third Thursday of each month.</p>
<p>There is an Applebee's at the Gateway, a short free Trax ride away from our meeting location, so I anticipate we'll head over there en masse after the presentation for the after-party. They also validate an hour of parking I think if anyone wanted to drive over there rather than come back to get a car.</p>
<p>If we find that the downtown location is for whatever reason undesirable, we can switch things up. Since I live in Draper, I would be happy to do the after party at the Draper Applebee's if people would prefer, but I suspect our friends from the North might not like driving down there just for a different Applebee's, but I could be wrong. </p>
