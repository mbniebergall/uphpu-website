## Talk Description

For every short-cut taken technical debt is added to a project. Taking that path may come from one of many factors, including inexperience, time constraints, scope creep, or lack of resources. Managing technical debt with a professional approach can reduce the high interest rate you may be currently experiencing and lower team stress. That technical burden can be properly managed by giving proper attention, time, and resources to paying down the debt on a regular basis. Explore ways to consistently reduce technical debt and discuss best practices with fellow debtors. Learn how your code score can improve and how you can avoid going bankrupt from a proper technical debt management approach.
