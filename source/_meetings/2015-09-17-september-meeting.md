## Talk Description

There comes a point in time with a website when eventually need to do something in the background. There are always cron jobs, but eventually those either don't scale well, or are not responsive enough. Learn about how to help your website efficiently scale by using workers. We'll touch briefly the fundamental theory behind workers and how to easily implement them. We'll learn about several different technologies to help manage workers such as Beanstalkd, Supervisord, Redis, and others. We'll show a live demo of PHP workers performing tasks and you'll leave with sound understanding of how to implement workers in your own application.
