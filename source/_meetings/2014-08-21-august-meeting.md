Velda Denison, who is a long time UPHPU member, will be doing a live demo on 
how to design a website. As web developers we can always learn basic design
principles so that not only is what we build awesome under the hood, but it
looks good as well. She works for [Automattic](http://automattic.com/), the company 
behind [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), and is all around an awesome member of
our community. Make sure to come out!

## The After Party

The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about
8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.

## Meeting Venue: Needle

The Meetings are still at Needle, their address is:

Needle Inc.<br/>
14864 Pony Express Road<br/>
Bluffdale, UT 84065

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!

Thanks,

Justin Carmony
