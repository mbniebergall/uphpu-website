## CHANGE IN DATE

**This meeting has been moved from the 3rd Thursday in February to the 4th Thursday! This was done to accomidate Juliette's schedule. Please make sure you come on the 26th, not on the 19th.**

## Talk Description

This year we will have who I believe to be the longest distance speaker
UPHPU has ever had! Juliette, who is from the Netherlands, is road tripping
through the United States and will be swinging through Utah to say hello. 

She will be talking about "The Big 'Why equal doesn't equal' Quiz." It will cover topics such as variable typing, type juggling, variable testing, defensive coding etc. She gave this talk at Sunshine PHP, and it is a great way to peak "under the hood" of PHP on how it's variables work.
