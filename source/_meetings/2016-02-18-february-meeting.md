Second meeting of the year, back to our regular schedule, but in our new location at Vivint!

## Talk: Introduction to Laravel

Welcome to the world of Laravel, I'll be your guide. We'll touch on many topics, then I'll show you a basic application using many of the tools Laravel offers. We'll go through installation, configuration, routing, database usage, views, events, and Artisan.

## Brian J. Rogers

"I've been working with PHP for several years but most recently have been exclusively using Laravel. I currently work for a company called ControlPad in Orem as their Senior Technology Director."

## Venue: Vivint

Vivint<br/>
3401 Ashton Blvd<br/>
Lehi, Utah 84043

How to get there:

The address is 3401 Ashton Blvd, though some mapping tools put that a little far down the street (if so, try 2719 Ashton Blvd instead). It's the first office building south of the intersection, nearest to the Dickeys BBQ on the corner.

Just come in the front door and we'll be on the first floor, to the right.

The front door will be locked, but there's a guard on duty right inside that can let folks in, and we're really close to the front door, so we should be able to help people get in pretty easily.

If you can't get in, call 801-391-8249 and we'll get you in!

## The After Party

We're going to try something new and go to CJW's for the After Party. Come check it out with us.

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!
