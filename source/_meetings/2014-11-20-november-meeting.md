For November we're excited to have Logan Farr give his "Introduction to Drupal" talk:

## Talk Description

What exactly is Drupal, and why should you use it?

Drupal is a powerful content management framework, and figuring 
out how to get it up and running can be tricky. The administration 
bar can be confusing, and the way popular modules work can be even 
more so.
 
In this presentation, I will share my experience and advice on 
beginning a Drupal website. This includes: navigating admin areas; 
best practice configurations, users and permissions, blocks, 
modules, and tips and tricks.

## Logan Farr's Bio

Logan is a Computer Science student at the University of Utah. He 
works for as a web developer in Drupal for Lever Pulley, in 
addition to some of his own projects (which include building 
websites, learning Computer Vision libraries, and building 3D 
printers). Logan has been working with Drupal for about a year. 
His passions lay in 3D printing, Computer Vision, and most 
recently, Artificial Intelligence. 


## The After Party

The After Party will be at the traditional location of Applebee's in Draper. We typically head over there at about
8:30-9:00, so watch Twitter and we'll announce when we're heading over.

## Meeting Venue: Needle

The Meetings are still at Needle, their address is:

Needle Inc.<br/>
14864 Pony Express Road<br/>

Look forward to seeing everyone on Thursday!

Thanks,
