## Talk Description

I'll be giving a talk about Doctrine in Apigility.  This will be a live coding presentation in which I create a fully authenticated OAuth2 API, connect to it through REST, and authenticate remotely using an Authorization Code.  Other Doctrine features will include filtering API requests through the Doctrine QueryBuilder,

Here's the OAuth2 library: [https://github.com/TomHAnderson/zf-oauth2-doctrine](https://github.com/TomHAnderson/zf-oauth2-doctrine). Here's the skeleton I'll be teaching from (in development): [https://github.com/TomHAnderson/apigility-oauth2-doctrine-skeleton](https://github.com/TomHAnderson/zf-oauth2-doctrine).

## Tom Anderson's Bio

Tom started programming on the C128 and left computers at 17 to serve in the Utah National Guard where he worked in pharmacy. With civility, Tom worked in investigational drugs where he was given several dBASE IV databases to manage. With this re-start in data Tom began work as a programmer. He picked up PHP in 1999 when he created db.etree.org. Now he writes engineering applications in Doctrine 2 and Zend Framework 2.


## The After Party
