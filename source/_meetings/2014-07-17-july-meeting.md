We have an awesome meeting lined up for this Thursday (July 17th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. First off we'll have a quick
introduction (about 10 to 15 minutes) on <a href="https://apigility.org/">Apigility</a> by H Hatfield. Then we'll have our
main presentation by Eric Berry talking about <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a> and integrating it into your PHP
Applications. Single Page Apps and JavaScript frameworks have been a huge
topic and trend for the last year or two, and this is a great opportunity to come hear about one of the main ones.

## Short Presentation: Apigility Intro

#### About Apigility

From the Apigility Website:

> Creating APIs for your applications shouldn't be hard.
>
> Apigility is an API Builder, designed to simplify creating and maintaining useful, easy to consume, and well
> structured APIs. Regardless of your experience in API building, with Apigility you can build APIs that enable
> mobile apps, developer communities, and any other consumer controlled access to your applications.
>
> Apigility can be used to implement APIs in PHP. We developed Apigility using Zend Framework 2, but this doesn't
> mean you have to use this framework to develop your API. You can use Apigility in any PHP application, using all
> the libraries and frameworks that you want.

#### Presenter: H Hatfield

Since H still hasn't given me his Bio, I'll give it for him! H is the Director of Development for Deseret Digital Media
on the Marketplace team. He oversees many of KSL.com's sites such as KSL Deals, KSL Jobs, KSL Local, Utah.com, and
several others. Yes, his whole first name is spelt with a single character, "H", and he is normally pretty busy trying
to keep up with his twin toddlers at home. He is also a pretty good guy.
