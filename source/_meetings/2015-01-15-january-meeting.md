## Talk Description

To kick off the new year we're going to have a talk on, well,
giving talks! If you've ever wanted to give a talk at a usergroup
or conference, but didn't know where to start or just need a little
confidence, this is the presentation to come to!

We'll have Justin Carmony (me) go over how he prepares, practices,
and gives a technical talk. We'll discuss different methods for slides,
different formats, and how to prepare for your audience. We'll finish
by talking about getting submitting Call for Papers (CfPs) to usergroups, regional conferences, 
and national conferences.

And, to be honest, this is a great way to help find some speakers for the rest of
the year for UPHPU! :)
