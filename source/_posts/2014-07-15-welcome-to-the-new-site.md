Though it is slightly old news, I thought we should announce that we have a new website for UPHPU! The great thing
is that it is statically generate, meaning that it is very easy to have anyone contribute. All of the code is up on
[uphpu-website GitHub repo](https://github.com/uphpu/uphpu-website) and you can easily create a fork, make some changes,
and submit a pull request.

While the new design looks awesome, I'm still trying to finish all of the little pages across the site. So if you have
some time, feel free to hit me up on the IRC channel and ask for any things that need to be done.

Thanks,
Justin Carmony
