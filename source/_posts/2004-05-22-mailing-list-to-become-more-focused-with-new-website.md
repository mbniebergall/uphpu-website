<p>With the launch of our new website comes many new features that will allow us to better communicate and collaborate. Administration, members, and visitors now have the opportunity to submit and publish articles, reviews, news, links, and announcements through the website. This will allow us to limit the amount of traffic that we will need to use on the mailing list for group business and announcements; leaving it open for what it is intended for: the discussion of PHP, web development, and what we're working on.</p>
<p>Some of these news features include...</p>
