<p>This monthâ€™s Geek Lunch is going to be in downtown SLC at the Rodizio Grill in Trolley Square! </p>
<p> I have setup reservations for 15 though Iâ€™m pretty sure that will need to increase this.  Please Please Please RSVP so that I can give an accurate count to them.  This is their opening week, in fact, the day after grand opening, so itâ€™ll likely be packed!</p>
