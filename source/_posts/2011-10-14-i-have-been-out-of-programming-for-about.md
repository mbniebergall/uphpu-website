<p>I have been out of programming for about a year now and looking for work. Was using ASP and MSSQL but do have a small server setup and running for over 5 years now that was developed in Apache, PHP 4.3.8 and MySQL 4.0.14. Was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to learn about the new releases of PHP 5.X.X and any good tutorial websites. You can access my server and website at static IP http://166.70.20.140 I am using Xmission as ISP and they have no issues with doing this. THANX!</p>
