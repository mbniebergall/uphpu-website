<p>We are excited to announce that our own Jon Jensen was one of the eight tying winners of the Mozy Programming Deathmatch. Since there was no clear winner after the final challenge, the $10,000 was split 8 ways. What makes it especially newsworthy however is that Jon did all of the tests in PHP, much to the surprise of the organizers and competitors! Read more about this on <a href="http://jenseng.com/archives/000052.html">Jon's blog</a> and the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/business/ci_4614537">Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p>
