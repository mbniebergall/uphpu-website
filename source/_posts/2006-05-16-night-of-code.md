<p>For our <a href="/calendar_event.php?eid=20060516122915964">May meeting</a>, we passed on our usual platform and substituted the presentation with some hands-on hacking, discussion, and review. Members brought their laptops, projects or something was stumping them, for an hour and a half of enlightenment and productivity.</p>
