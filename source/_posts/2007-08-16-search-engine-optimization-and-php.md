<p>For our August <a href="http://uphpu.org/meetings/">meeting</a>, Sheri Bigelow will be presenting on Search Engine Optimization and PHP. Learn more about Sheri by browsing her <a href="http://designsimply.com">blog</a>, <a href="http://designsimply.com/about/">website</a>, and <a href="http://istockphoto.com/designsimply">portfolio</a>. For those who would like to come but find distance to be a barrier, we are trying to setup something so that you will be able to hear it. More info if it becomes available.  </p>
<p class="alert">This month's meeting has been postponed a week and will occur on August twenty-third.</p>
<p class="note">In addition to Sheri's topic, we will be meeting with UPHPU members to see how we can make the meetings better.</p>
