  content: The documentation on php.net is done pretty well.  Having user submitted
    comments on the docs page has helped fill in holes that the docs don't always
    mention.

<p>For our <a href="/events/">January meeting</a>, <a href="http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/">Justin Carmony</a> will cover PHP fundamentals with a presentation on reading the fabulous manual. For a new person to PHP, reading the documentation can be a daunting task. Even worse when you have legions of other developers screaming the acronym "RTFM!" Hopefully we can shed some light on how to get the most out of PHP Documentation, how to search it, how to understand it, and how to get help if the documentation doesn't answer your questions. Justin Carmony will be giving the presentation, and will leave time for questions. You're not alone in learning PHP, let the Utah PHP Usergroup help you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Justin Carmony has worked in web development professionally for the last<br />
five years. With emphasis on PHP, .NET, and Web Services, he has worked on<br />
projects ranging from simple websites to complex communications between<br />
thousands of remote systems. He currently is working as an independent<br />
contractor & private consultant. If you have any questions, comments, or<br />
curiosities you can contact him (justin AT justincarmony DOT com) or read<br />
about his latest endeavors at his blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trevor Sharpe will then follow with Basic Linux Server Administration, covering the advanced topic. Many programmers are finding themselves needing to understand and administer linux servers.  This presentation is focused on learning how to effectively use the server through scripts, etc.  Q & A session on admining to follow.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trevor Sharpe is a Systems Administrator for a company in SLC and is also a board member for Utah Open Source.</p></blockquote>
