<p>For our <a href="/events/">September meeting</a>, our founder, <a href="/author/wade/">Wade Shearer</a> will present on front-end web development, specifically focusing on markup, styles, and foundation architectural structures. The presentation will be a live coding demonstration developing a global site template using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets. He will take an audience-submitted design and produce production-ready code and site assets as far as time and questions will allow. Attendees interested in submitting a design should come to the meeting prepared with a digital copy of artwork for a website or web application (layered Photoshop file preferably). The design used will be selected randomly from those in attendance. A basic understanding of web technology and coding is recommended.</p>
