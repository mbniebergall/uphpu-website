<p><a href="http://www.dynamicwebpages.de/">DynamicWebPages.de</a> has their latest <a href="http://www.dynamicwebpages.de/60.php-statistiken.php">PHP Usage Statistics</a> posted today. Things just keep looking up for PHP usage - this month it gained a good chunk of domains from last month.PHP, in September, has been installed on approxamately 17,245,242 domains working its way onwards and upwards consistently. The number of actual IP addresses dropped a little this month, but not enough to cause much of a stir. Of course, numbers like this do show that most of the hosting environments out there with PHP are shared services, having serveral hundred domains on each.</p>
