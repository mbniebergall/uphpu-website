<p>I am excited to announce that our four-hundredth member has just registered with the group! We have doubled our membership in the past eight months. If you recall, I sent out an announcement at the close of 2004 announcing the registration of our two-hundredth member. We are continuing to grow and increase the reach of our efforts. News of our articles and activities continue to get picked up by high-profile PHP news sites and to be contacted by renowned PHP and open-source speakers asking for the opportunity to present at our meetings.</p>
<p>As always, I would like to encourage everyone to participate actively in the group and to take advantage of all of the excellent resources that we have brought together, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/">Our website</a>. We provide the latest news on PHP, LAMP, any web development. Interact with other members with forum-style commenting and polls. Contribute content by submitting articles and links.</li>
<li><a href="/staticpages/index.php?page=200405211727498">Our syndication services</a>. We provide RSS and iCalendar feeds, allowing you to an additional medium to stay abreast of current events, news, and stories.</li>
<li><a href="/staticpages/index.php?page=20040521003849494">Our Mailing lists</a>. Subscribe to our mailling lists, where we discuss current events, technical topics, and assist each other with questions and personal tasks. We also have lists for job announcements and general group announcements.</li>
<li><a href="/index.php?topic=Presentations">Our presentations</a>. We host monthly meetings where we have presentations and training sessions on PHP and applicable web development topics.</li>
<li><a href="/staticpages/index.php?page=20041108084427796">Our library</a>. The UPHPU has a library full of reference and training manuals on subjects relating to and/or about PHP, MySQL, Linux, Apache, and many other topics. Members may check any of our titles free of charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that you find our group valudable and that we together may continue to find greater success by our skills and knowledge. We look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night.</p>
