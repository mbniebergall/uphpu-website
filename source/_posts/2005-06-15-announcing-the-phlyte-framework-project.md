<p>Our group project to build a framework finally has a name: Phlyte (pronounced like the word "flight"). It emphasizes the goal of our framework to be lightweight, not too complex, flexible, and easy to use.</p>
<p>I would invite anyone who is interested to subscribe to the new mailing list. Our in-person meetings that will occur probably 2-3 times per month are important, but not strictly required. Participation in the IRC channel at #uphpu or #phlyte on irc.freenode.net is highly encouraged. Subscribing to the mailing list is pretty much required.</p>
<p>A big part of Phlyte development will be about teaching each other how to be better developers, especially with PHP (and Python, for those helping with the Python version of Phlyte). Most of this will happen in the meetings and in team meetings, so it is important that everyone participate as much as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has participated so far, and I look forward to working with each of you more in the future!</p>
