<p>Our third official Phlyte meting will be held on Thursday, June 30th, at the usual Salt Lake City location at Code Greene in Foothill Village. Everyone interested in the project is encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>The goal is to continue to make the important decisions and to get started actually writing some code this week. We'd like to cover directory structure for the site, coding style standards, and some basic guidelines for what code belongs in which files.</p>
<p>After the meeting is over, this article will be updated with links to an audio recording, if we can get one, and a meeting report with a summary of the decisions we made. Don't forget to use the #phlyte IRC channel and the Phlyte mailing list, too.</p>
