<p>For our June <a href="/events">meeting</a>, <a href="http://utahcon.com/wordpress/">Adam Barrett</a> will present on fundamentals of programming in PHP. PHP is a fast and loose language with many features and options that sometimes are used inappropriately. This short presentation will focus on 40 Best Practices to optimize code, and prepare PHP developers for a faster and better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Adam Barrett has been developing in PHP for about 10 years. Working for such internet giants as Overstock.com, GrabTakeOut.com, and most recently SOSStaffing.com, Adam has developed a little of everything including blogs, large scale ecommerce sites, intranets, mass email management systems, and PDF generating invoicing systems.</p>
