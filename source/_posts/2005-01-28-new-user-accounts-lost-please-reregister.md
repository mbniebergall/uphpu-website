<p>We are sorry to report, but an error occured during an upgrade to the system this morning and we lost some data. We were forced to roll the system back to an archive from two weeks ago. Although we have been able to recreate nearly every change or addition since then, a few comments and all new users accounts are missing. Thus, we will have to ask all new users that registered accounts since 14 January 2005, to <a href="http://uphpu.org/users.php?mode=new">reregister</a>. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
