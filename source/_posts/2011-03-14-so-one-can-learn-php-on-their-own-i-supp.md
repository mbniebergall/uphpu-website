    Hi Larry,

    I've taken classes at the U and SLCC.  Frankly, I would recommend getting an account at lynda.com.  You cane learn LOTS of things there for one low price.  The videos, tutorials, and example files are all excellent, and they also teach some best practices.  All the PHP classes I've found are very slow and not very good at heading you in the direction of real life application of PHP.

    I hope this helps!

    Tony =)

  content: If you're just getting started, I really enjoyed these tutorials-<a href="http://blog.themeforest.net/screencasts/diving-into-php-video-series/"
    rel="nofollow">Dive into PHP</a>. They don't go too deep into the language but
    they give a good foundation. From there I would check out the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/"
    rel="nofollow">PHP Manual</a>.

<p>So one can learn PHP on their own I suppose, but where is the best place in Utah to take a class on PHP development? UVU? SLCC? somewhere else? All recommendations are appreciated.</p>
