<p>I am excited to announce that we now have a <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> Group for UPHPU members. You can add a note to your LinkedIn profile that states that you are a member and a UPHPU badge will appear. Join the UPHPU LinkedIn group <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/25209/46099C1DE7D1">here</a>. Please note that I will have to approve each, so be patient as it might taken a few minutes. Please also note that if you want the UPHPU badge to appear on your profile, you will have to edit your profile, scroll to the bottom where groups are, click "settings" next to the UPHPU badge, and then change "Displaying the group logo to non-group members:" to "Yes" and save the changes.</p>
