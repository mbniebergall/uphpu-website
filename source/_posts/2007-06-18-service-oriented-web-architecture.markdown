<p>For our June <a href="/meetings/">meeting</a>, Boguslaw Gil will present on a project called SOWA (Service Oriented Web Architecture). He will cover building applications, concept, content object protocol for exchanging content objects between the browser and web server, and collaborations with web services.</p>
<p class="note">SOWA is a software architecture and design methodology for processing and exchanging content in a Web environment over services. SOWA is an extension for current Web technologies and simplifies the design and development of interactive Web applications by separating content layout and UI events from content, and making browser a state-full client to Web server.</p>
