<p>For January's presentation, <a href="/users.php?mode=profile&uid=481">Richard K. Miller</a> presented on model-view-controller (MVC) frameworks. MVC framework Ruby on Rails has received a lot of attention in the past year for making web app development easier and more enjoyable.  Several similar frameworks are available for PHP.  Special guest John Peterson of <a href="http://mytechsupport.com">MyTechSupport.com</a>, the creators of a PHP framework called <a href="http://phpontrax.com/">PHP on Trax</a> also presented. PHP on Trax was used to rapidly develop <a href="KatrinaHousing.org">KatrinaHousing.org</a>, a highly trafficked website that helped hurricane victims find housing.</p>
