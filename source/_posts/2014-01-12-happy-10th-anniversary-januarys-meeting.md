<p>Everyone, I canâ€™t believe it, but this January will mark 10 years of UPHPU meetings! Weâ€™re so excited, weâ€™re having a little bit of a special meeting for the occasion!</p>
<p>The meeting will be this Thursday (Jan. 16th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. Itâ€™ll be Elizabeth Naramore from GitHub talking about "GitHub: More than Just Code.â€ We will also me slightly modifying the after party location for this month, so read on for the details.</p>
<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>
<p>"It's no secret that at GitHub, we use GitHub to write the code that runs GitHub. But what you may not know is that we also use GitHub to manage GitHub the company. In this talk, I'll show you practical ways that we use our own system in a non-code context. You'll learn how we track projects and to-do lists, discuss and collaborate on corporate policies, communicate news to a highly distributed company, coordinate events, update and collaborate on internal and external documentation, and even onboard new Hubbers. You'll come away from this talk with a whole new perspective on using GitHub."</p>
<p><strong>About Elizabeth Naramore</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth is an author, speaker, mentor, and recovering PHP developer. She currently works on the Community Team at GitHub, and loves finding new solutions to old problems.</p>
<p>After Party:  Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn 9:00 PM</p>
<p>For this meeting only, weâ€™ll be moving the after party to the Belgian Waffle &amp; Omelet Inn in Midvale (details &amp; map: https://www.skiphp.com/mingle/waffle) I also believe that the food will be covered by Jared Smith from Blue Host, who is one of the original members from back in the day. :)</p>
<p><strong>Ski PHP</strong></p>
<p>Youâ€™ve all likely have heard that Utah is having itâ€™s first regional PHP conference, Ski PHP! (https://www.skiphp.com/) It is great to see how awesome our community has grown over the last 10 years, and that our user group is one of the oldest PHP user groups today. If you havenâ€™t had a chance to sign up to attend, I highly recommend you give it a shot.</p>
