<p>Justin's been around the block a few times, and knows how to find and identify code that is in need of a redo, and will show us the right way to do the update. He will show us how to take old code and make it new again, preparing it for years of maintenance-free bliss. He may even do some live demos I think, so bring some of the worst PHP code you can get your hands on, and perhaps we can try to stump him. If you've been to one of Justin's presentations before, I don't need to tell you that it will be one you won't want to miss.</p>
<p>Usual meeting details apply:</p>
<p>7:00pm at C7 Bluffdale Datacenter</p>
<p>Afterparty at Draper Applebeeâ€™s (12300 South, just east of I-15)</p>
