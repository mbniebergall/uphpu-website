<p>For our November <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Joseph Brower will be visiting from Idaho to present about scalability platforms. As usual, we'll follow it with our Applebee's aftermeeting. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
<p>As the hype around the "cloud" continues to grow, the importance of understanding how it works becomes more and more relevant.  This presentation will provide an overview of how an application should be designed to ensure that it can scale well.  The presentation will start with an explanation of how some cloud services work followed by things to consider when designing your application to up scale.  We'll finish the presentation (time pending) with a demonstration of a cloud driven work flow and end with a Q/A period.</p>
<p>The presentation will be given with the assumption that the people listening are familiar with PHP development, along with version control systems.</p>
