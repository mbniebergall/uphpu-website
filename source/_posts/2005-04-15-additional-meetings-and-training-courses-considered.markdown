<p>We are condering some new ideas and events to increase group participation and skills. Please take a moment to vote.  We are very interested in feedback from the group and nonmembers alike.</p>
<p>First, we are interested in knowing what individuals are looking for in our montly presentations? Are you satisfied or are could you use more? Why do you come? Why don't you come? What would bring you out more often? Would you like to meet more than once a month?</p>
<p>Second, we are considered sponsoring monthly or even semi-monthly training courses. Please let us know if this is something that you could benefit from and would be interested in. How much would you be willing to pay? The cost of these would be minimal and would for the most part be only to cover production costs.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone's interest and participation!</p>
