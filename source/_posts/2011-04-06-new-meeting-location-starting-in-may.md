  content: Wade. I work for a company called Idea Partnership which is a small incubator
    for web start-ups. This building would also be available for meeting in the future.
    We are located at 4770 S. 900 E. If in the future you need something more between
    downtown and draper, let me know.

<p>Center 7, a gracious sponsor for several years has offered to bring us back home to the old Linux Networx building in Bluffdale. Center 7 purchased the building recently and added it to their list of data centers along the Wasatch Front. You might have read in the news a few months back about Twitter hosting their service (at least in part) from there. Feedback indicates that the location is more convenient for most of the group.</p>
