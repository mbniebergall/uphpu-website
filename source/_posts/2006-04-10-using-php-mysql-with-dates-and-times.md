<p>With the recent discussion on the mailing list about dates and times and how they are stored in a MySQL database; I figured this article would provide some additional information on how others use dates and times.  The article offers code examples and provides some clear logic and why not to use the normal timestamp for everything.</p>
<p>Check out the article @ <a href="http://www.phpit.net/article/handling-date-time-php-mysql/">PHPit</a>!</p>
