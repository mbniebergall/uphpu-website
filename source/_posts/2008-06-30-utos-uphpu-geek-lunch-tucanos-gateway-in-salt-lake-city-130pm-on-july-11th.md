<p>Greets Geeks!</p>
<p> The July Geek Lunch is going to be at Tucanoâ€™s at the Gateway in Salt Lake.</p>
<p> Now, I know, we tried Tucanoâ€™s before, and true they dogged us at the last moment; but, they have tried to make things right.  Those that RSVPâ€™d last time will have their plate at half!  When you RSVP, please let me know if you were in this group. </p>
<p> Like our last event, expect to see all kinds of coders (Python, PERL, PHP, etc), bloggers, graphic artists, local businesses owners and shutterbugs in the fray. </p>
<p> You can RSVP at this URL - http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/843968/</p>
