<p>The meeting will be this Thursday (April 17th) at Needle at 7:00 PM. It will be Mark Niebergall from i3logix talking about "Abstraction, Object Interfaces, Traits, Namespaces, and Dependency Injection: Cool Stuff in PHP."</p>
<p><strong>Talk Summary</strong></p>
<p>"This presentation will focus on some of the really cool stuff in PHP that you may not know of or not know quite how to use. There will be examples and discussion regarding abstracts, interfaces, traits, namespaces, and dependency injection. Have you heard of some of these and always wanted to use them in your PHP application but didn't know where to start? You will learn the benefit of each one and when to use them in your existing or new application. This will be a perfect presentation to help you advance your skill-set to include these tools to make your code even more clean, structured, and awesome!"</p>
