    "We would only be able to offer a percentage of any future profits instead of a set pay, but there is no guarantee of anything since itâ€™s just an idea right now..."

    I can't count how many times I've heard these exact words. What this really actually means is "our idea, which we were too shy to even mention here publicly, doesn't seem to be interesting to investors, so we're just going to wing it."

    It never actually works out, and I wouldn't recommend anyone (friend or not) jumps on board with this work. If they can't find funding, it wasn't a good business model in the first place. Not being able to even mention what the work is also means there's a lack of confidence that this is actually even an innovative project since there's worry that "anyone could jump in front of us, it doesn't actually take anyone special to do this."

<p>I'm a student at BYU right now and a friend and I have come up with an idea for a website that we think could go really far.  We've been struggling to find people skilled enough who are willing to give it a try with us though.  One of my friends suggested that I ask on here and see if anyone is up to it.  We would only be able to offer a percentage of any future profits instead of a set pay, but there is no guarantee of anything since it's just an idea right now...  Anyway, let me know if you want to join in.  Or if I'm even posting this in the right place...</p>
