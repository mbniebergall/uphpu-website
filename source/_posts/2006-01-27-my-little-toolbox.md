<p>I just finished reading an article on Linux.com that talks about useful tools that a system administrator uses. This is a great article to read and glean if you are doing any system administration with your PHP development. At work and as a contractor I can only stress the importance that a developer needs to be familiar with system administration. You can check out the article <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/01/17/2036214">here.</a></p>
<p>Here are some command line tools that i use almost on a daily bases to help out with system administration tasks.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>find</li>
<li>xargs</li>
<li>sed</li>
<li>awk</li>
<li>nmap</li>
<li>netstat</li>
<li>bash shell scripting</li>
<li>column</li>
<li>expand</li>
<li>split</li>
<li>comm</li>
<li>sort</li>
<li>diff</li>
<li>dig</li>
<li>dsplit</li>
<li>du</li>
<li>df</li>
<li>free</li>
<li>grep</li>
<li>screen</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the ones that I use. One point I would like to make is that by becoming familiar with additional commands you will start to become more proficient in your system admin tasks; obviously resulting in a sharper developer.</p>
