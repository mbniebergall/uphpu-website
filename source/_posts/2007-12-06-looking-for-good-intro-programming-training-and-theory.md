<p>So I understand the basic of HTML, the concepts of CSS (even if I am still a newb that can't write it from scratch) and a master of design (;)). But Wade suggested I get some good intro theory training before diving straight into PHP.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any good online courses or materials available for such a venture?</p>
