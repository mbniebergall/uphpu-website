  content: "I Googled \"PHP training Salt Lake City\" and ended up at this post. Per
    your suggestions, I looked into MindCenter and New Horizons, but there's nothing
    scheduled in the immediate future. I even tried to check out a class at SLCC that
    seemed perfect (\"Students learn to create E-Commerce solutions and Internet applications
    using XHTML, JavaScript, PHP, and MYSQL. Students will also be introduced to CGI
    and Java Applets.\") but it was cancelled due to lack of students. \r\n\r\nMy
    situation may be similar to vuel's. I'm proficient in HTML, can stumble around
    CSS, but feel lost when it comes to PHP. I'm a web designer and everytime I turn
    around these days I'm running to PHP . I really want to learn this stuff. \r\n\r\nI
    found an online tutorial site: http://apex.vtc.com/php.php For $30 a month you
    can go through as many tutorials as you can handle. Compared to these 2K training
    courses I was reading about, this seems too good to be true. But, they also sell
    CD versions of all their \"classes\" so maybe that's where they make their money.\r\n\r\nSo,
    my question is: What do you think of the idea of online training to learn PHP?
    Is it a matter of discipline, which makes sitting through a 5-day course more
    practical in the long run? \r\n\r\nI like this place. You should all go to lunch
    again. I'd come."

  content: Not sure of what type of theory Wade suggested or what type of information
    you are looking for to start programming PHP. The recommendations I would make
    is to get a cheap book or go to zend.com and go through their tutorials as they
    are a good resource for new programmers. Another good avenue is to find someone
    who knows PHP well (most likely a lot of members here do) and see if you can trade
    some design work for PHP training, this works well as I am a horrible designer
    but a great coder. If you are looking for more certification type stuff you can
    checkout brainbench.com or even look at zend.com for their certification classes.

  content: i would suggest getting some books first before spending the money on training
    classes, unless your work can fit the bill.  I find that many classes are just
    going to follow what is popular in the latest books. Save some time and start
    with a great book first is mho.

  content: "Great advice, guys! Also, trading design for training sounds like a awesome
    idea. Anybody interested, just let me know.\r\n\r\nSo, I should start with a good
    book, then go from there, you say? Any specific book you can suggest would be
    appreciated. Heck, I'll just go hang out at Barnes and Noble and see what's out
    there. But, if you DO have a specific title that you know is decent, that would
    give me something to start with.\r\n\r\nHere's where I'm at. It's not like I want
    to start programming from scratch, but like twice now I've had clients that needed
    help with some PHP shopping cart they got for free. I had no clue. Plus, a lot
    of the contract work for interface designers requires some knowledge of PHP.\r\n\r\nSo,
    when is everybody going to lunch again?"

  content: The only books I have on PHP are from WROX publishing and they are PHP4
    for gaining a basic understanding of PHP, MYSQL, some apache configuration some
    basic setup. Of course PHP4 has been replaced by PHP5 and PHP5 is now more object
    oriented (still not 100% in mho). But the PHP5 book by rocks is the PHP5 for professionals
    still a good beginners book to get. There are some other cookbook types written
    by other companies that I have browsed. To save some money I would go to borders
    and see what they have along with your local library find the ones you want then
    purchase used ones off of amazon.

  content: Speaking of books, I would like to remind everyone that UPHPU has a <a
    href="/books/library/" rel="nofollow">library</a> of books that you can check
    out for free. We also have relationships with most major publishers and can usually
    get a copy of any book that interests you in exchange for a short <a href="/category/reviews/"

<p>So I understand the basic of HTML, the concepts of CSS (even if I am still a newb that can't write it from scratch) and a master of design (;)). But Wade suggested I get some good intro theory training before diving straight into PHP.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any good online courses or materials available for such a venture?</p>
