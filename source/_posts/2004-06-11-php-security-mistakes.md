<p><a href="http://www.devshed.com">Dev Shed</a> has an article about <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/PHP-Security-Mistakes/">common PHP security mistakes</a>, and how to avoid them. It's fairly basic stuff -- but a good review for even the most expert programmers. If you're not following their advice, you should be.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated note, I noticed that Dev Shed appears to be using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a> or something with very similar behaviour. I checked it out at <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>, on the off chance that Dev Shed had that information exposed. Interestingly, Netcraft <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.devshed.com">replied</a> that it has been asked not to report  on Dev Shed -- which is a request I didn't even know could be made. You learn something every day . . .</p>
