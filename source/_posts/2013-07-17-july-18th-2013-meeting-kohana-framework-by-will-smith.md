<p>This month's presentation will be an introduction to the Kohana Framework by Will Smith.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be July 18th at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>
<p>Be cause Will is a man of many words, he gave me this very lengthy summary of his talk:</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kohana is a lightweight open source PHP5 framework that is easy to learn and very flexible. In this presentation we will introduce key concepts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bio he sent was every more lengthy!</p>
<blockquote><p>Will Smith: Utah native. Family man. Mortician. SysAdmin. Open Source advocate.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'll see if you can notice which one of those credentials is not like the other. :P But Will is an excellent speaker who is very fun to listen to. He has served on the Utah Open Source Foundation's Core Team and Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there at the meeting!</p>
