<p>I'm pleased to announce this month's meeting:</p>
<p>Thursday, January 19th, at 7pm at C7 Bluffdale Datacenter</p>
<p>Joanna Carmony: Best Accounting Practices for the Web Development Industry</p>
<p>Come and learn from an accountant with years of experience what you should be doing better with your books. There should be something for everyone, whether you own a web development business, own a business that does some web development, are self-employed, or just do some freelance on the side.</p>
<p>As time allows, we'll have a round-table discussion to take advantage of the collective expertise in the group on the subject, and discuss any questions you may have about the business side of web development.</p>
<p>As usual, we'll be having our after-party at the Draper Applebees, starting around 9pm. Feel free to join us!</p>
