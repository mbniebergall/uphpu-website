<p>We will be holding another Geek Lunch this friday. If there continues to be interest, we'll probably try to do this once a month or so. The last one was at the Dragon Diner (Chinese food) on 3300 South and 1300 East, and we'd like to keep rotating locations so that the driving distances are reasonable for people as often as possible. So far most of the interest has been in SL County, though there's at least Timothy in Ogden who'd love it if we did something up that way. Of course, nothing stops us from having them in different locations (i.e. Utah Valley) too, even on the same day as a SL get together. We're open to suggestions for future venues too.</p>
