<p>We would like to remind everyone that August's meeting has been cancelled in favor of a family barbecue! Please note that it will be this Saturday, the twenty-first, instead of the usual time.</p>
<p>Bring your family, your meat, and a potluck dish to share. Hamburger and hot dog buns will be provided, and a cauldron of root beer will be brewing. There will be prizes for young and old, games for the kids, and geeky discussion for the adults.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.uphpu.org/calendar_event.php?eid=20040712121930361">calendar</a> for more details, a map, and to RSVP</a>.</p>
