<p>I'm pleased to announce this month's meeting topic is  High availability with memcache.  Memcache is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. The talk will include live demonstrations of memcache.</p>
<p>Presenting will be Jeff Sherlock who is primarily a LAMP developer with a focus on creating scalable solutions. He's been working with PHP for over 4 years with most of that geared towards backend work. He loves designing database schemas, optimizing existing processes, and generally making slow things run fast. He currently work as a PHP Developer for a financial services company in Salt Lake City. He is also a part-time student in the U of U Computer Science program.</p>
