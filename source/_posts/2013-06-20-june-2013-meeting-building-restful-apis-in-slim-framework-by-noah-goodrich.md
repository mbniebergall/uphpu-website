<p>This month's presentation will be on "Building RESTful API's in Slim Framework" by Noah Goodrich.Â It is important to note we are at ourÂ <strong>new venue so please share thisÂ announcementÂ with people you know who are coming.</strong>Â  It will be at Needle.com at 7:00 PM tomorrow (May 15th) and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the talk:</p>
<blockquote><p>With a lot of applications being built out for mobile devices or javascript client apps, traditional server side languages and frameworks are becoming more and more often the tools for building web services rather than full stack sites. Slim is a framework that caters specifically to building RESTful web services in PHP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone tonight!</p>
<h2>Current Venue: Needle.com</h2>
<p>The current venue for the rest of this year at Needle.com. The great thing is it is in the same building complex as last year's venue, C7. Here is the new address (<a href="http://www.needle.com/contact.html">and map if you like</a>):</p>
