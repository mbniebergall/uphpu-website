<p>hello php utah.  long time coder, first time poster :)  I'm working on a new venture that is built on cakephp and wondering if there are any cakephp developers out that or if everyone has moved on to lithium apparently :).  I tried connecting on the cakephp user group but it appears defunct.   I've been out of the development scene for a few years but excited to get back in. Anyways, would love to connect with others with knowledge on cakephp and to get to know the community as a whole.</p>
