  content: "I currently work for a company with several developers who are all proficient
    in CakePHP. I have worked on about 3 projects so far all which used CakePHP. I
    started off as a CakePHP newbie so I printed off the PDF version of the manual
    (about 700 pages) and read through it. I think observing the design patterns of
    more experienced CakePHP developers has been helpful too. I also got our company
    to purchase a book from Amazon called \"CakePHP 1.3 Application Development Cookbook\"
    by Mariano Iglesias\". I'll let you know whether I think the book was helpful.
    \ Spending all day working on CakePHP projects which were designed by devs with
    many years of experience with CakePHP has definitely accelerated the learning
    process. \n\nI was at the last usergroup meeting &amp; I plan to attend future
    meetings as well. I noticed that at least a few people at the meeting were currently
    using CakePHP on their projects too."

<p>hello php utah.  long time coder, first time poster :)  I'm working on a new venture that is built on cakephp and wondering if there are any cakephp developers out that or if everyone has moved on to lithium apparently :).  I tried connecting on the cakephp user group but it appears defunct.   I've been out of the development scene for a few years but excited to get back in. Anyways, would love to connect with others with knowledge on cakephp and to get to know the community as a whole.</p>
