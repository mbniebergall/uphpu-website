<p>Well, the sun has really shined on use this past week. First, I would like to sincerelly thank each member that donated towards our new server fund! Your support is very much apprecaited by all. We have been very blessed.</p>
<p>I am very excited to announce to everyone that yesterday morning a group member's company responded to our plea and offered to sponsor us. They will be covering the rest of our needs for the new server. They will also be providing bandwidth and rack space.</p>
<p>Although the server is now taken care off, I would still like to encourage everyone to donate, as we still have some expenses and we would also like some funds to use for refreshments, activities, speakers for presentations and so forth.</p>
<p>Please take a minute to visit <a href="http://hostinginferno.com">Hosting Inferno</a> and thank them for their support. Please recommend them when consulting with clients.</p>
<p>So, thanks to all and we should be on the new server shortly. Enjoy your Thursday.</p>
