<p>I've noticed some confusion of late about the "@" operator and what it does and doesn't do. To try to clarify this, I've written up a quicky article <a href="http://thesmithfam.org/blog/">explaining some of the "@" operator's nuances</a> and provided some example code. Please comment if you find I've mistaken something. Enjoy!</p>
