    Looks good.

    WPS - time to sign up for gravatar :-)

    The 'Subscribe To Comments' plugin can be really handy as well, for those that want to follow a specific post/thread without having to subscribe to the whole comments feed.

<p>There's a new conversation happening at uphpu.org. You asked. I listened. I've upgraded to the P2 WordPress theme. It's all hopped-up on ajax and social juice. Everyone can now post directly from the home page and comment inline anywhere on the site. A customized version of P2 is forthcoming, but we might was well start enjoying the benefits of this platform in the meantime.</p>
<p>I have deleted all user accounts with zero posts so that we may start fresh. So, if you haven't posted or comments on uphpu.org previously, you'll need to create a new account.</p>
