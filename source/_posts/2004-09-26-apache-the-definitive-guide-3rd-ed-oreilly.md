<p>To cut to the chase, I heartily recommend this book. Any serious web server admin should have a copy of this book -- I've found it indispensable, and refer to it often. They're not exaggerating when they call it "The Definitive Guide"</p>
<p>Billed as, "Vital information for Apache Programmers and administrators," this book is definitely geared toward that audience -- programmers and admins. That said, the first chapter, "Getting Started," provides an excellent overview of basic web server concepts that most newbies could understand.</p>
<p><b>What I liked</b><br />I liked almost everything! I found the first half of the book (chapters 1-12) the most useful. These chapters covered just about everything you'd want to know about configuring and running apache. Beyond just the basics, the book covers in depth: virtual hosts, authentication, content description and modification, indexing, redirection, proxying, logging, security, and running a big web site. I came away with a much higher level of respect for Apache's capabilities -- I was really surprised how much I didn't know about Apache, and how much this book could tell me.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a very interesting section on writing modules for Apache which, though a little beyond my expertise, gave me a better understanding of Apache's inner workings.</p>
<p><b>Disappointments</b><br />My biggest disappointment with the book was that it dealt so little with PHP, which only got 6 pages. I would have been less disappointed if they hadn't 50-plus pages to CGI/Perl and 17 pages to Java. Additionally, their XML section dealt almost entirely with Perl and Java, ignoring PHP. Granted, this isn't a PHP-specific book, but (considering I got the book via a PHP user group) I hoped for equal coverage.</p>
