<p>If you have been lurking on the #uphpu irc channel then you have probably heard me talking about the eclipse IDE with others and especially the arch enemy of it, dataw0lf.</p>

<p>However, in the spirit of friendship I have create a special version of eclipse for linux gtk that has removed all the java libraries and have replaced them with Colorer, PyDev, Ruby-eclipse, and Perl EPIC.  Basically, I stripped out all the excess and put in the killer stuff. I also added FTP and WebDav support, CVS support, and SFTP support. This IDE will allow you to manage multiple projects and in various languages, not to mention it is half the size it was.  I will be writing up some articles on how to use UPHPU Eclipse for PHP and other development like Python and Ruby.  If you have heard me talk about eclipse and want to give it a try you can download it <a href="/downloads/uphpu-eclipse-linux-gtk.zip">here</a>.  I will be adding a windows and mac version to when time permits.  If you run into any issues or would like too added some additional plugins like subversion or c/c++ then shoot me a message on the #uphpu channel.</p>
