<p>This month's meeting on August 15th will be a slightly different format. Instead of a traditional presentation, we will be having an open discussion night with the theme: "Show &amp; Tell your Favorite Tools for PHP."</p>
<p>It will be an open discussion with a little structure of people showing some of their favorite tools they use while working with PHP. Whether it is a PHP Library, Editor, Debugger, or even favorite git command, it'll be a chance to see what people find useful while working with PHP. So if you have anything interesting to share, please feel free to show it off and talk just a little bit about why it is awesome.</p>
<p>There will be free pizza like usual, and we're hoping that everyone will be able to walk away with a slightly fuller brain and stomach. :)</p>
<h2>Current Venue: Needle.com</h2>
