<p>For our <a href="/about/meetings/">September meeting</a>, Justin Giboney will present an introduction course on flash actionscript.</p>
<p>Please note that this meeting will be held at an alternate location. The time, however, will be the same: 19:00.</p>
<p>Camp Williams<br />
Joint Language Training Center<br />
17800 South Camp Williams Rd.<br />

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=17800+S+Camp+Williams+Rd,+Riverton,+UT+84065&ie=UTF8&z=15&t=h&om=1&iwloc=A">view map</a></p>
<p>Directions: Enter the main Camp Williams entrance. You'll be required to show a picture ID at the guard shack. After passing the guard shack, turn right at the first street (there will be a softball field on your right). Follow this road to the very end. You will pass some white<br />
trailer buildings on the right. There are 3 new small buildings at the end. We are meeting in the middle building that is marked 9052. I'll have some signs up.</p>
