<p>Have you ever wanted to track something and see how it changes over time? Meet Graphite &amp; StatsD, a combo of tools that make real-time tracking an extremely easy breeze. We'll talk about how to set it up, how to start sending data to it, and how to get the most from your graphs &amp; data. Time permitting, and I'm feeling a little adventurous, we'll add some real-time tracking live to a production site to show how easy it is.</p>
<p>The details are same as usual - 3rd Thursday of the month (6/21), 7pm, at C7's Bluffdale Datacenter, with afterparty at Draper Applebee's (123rd south, just east of I-15). This will be an awesome presentation... see you there!</p>
