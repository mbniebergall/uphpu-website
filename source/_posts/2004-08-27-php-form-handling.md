<p>The <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/08/26/PHPformhandling.html">O'Reilly PHP Devcenter</a> has a <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/08/26/PHPformhandling.html">new article</a> posted seeking to help you out with your form handling with a listing of several tips to get started.
<p>Some of the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2004/08/26/PHPformhandling.html">topics mentioned</a> are: using $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] as the form action, using brackets for a "multivalued form parameter", dividing up the display/logic/validation of the form into their components.
<p>They also mention using PHP to your advantage when printing out form elements as well as looking into the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm">HTML_QuickForm</a> PEAR class to help you in your quest.</p>
