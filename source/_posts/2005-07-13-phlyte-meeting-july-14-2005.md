<p>Our 4th official Phlyte meeting will be held on Thursday, July 14, 2005, at the usual location (Code Greene, 1440 S Foothill Dr, SLC, in Foothill Village, above Blockbuster). Perhaps the most interesting agenda item is the logo contest. We've had a lot of great submissions, and we'll be showing them in the meeting, and taking a vote. It may finalize things, or just get us a short list of finalists, depending how it goes. We're planning on discussing the wiki and other infrastructure items, so we can start writing down all of our plans and decisions where everyone can see them. We'll also be discussing the planned directory structure and file layout. And then we'll write some code. Depending who is there, we may discuss database abstraction or the python port.</p>
<p>This entry will be updated with links to notes or other relevant documentation, along with any audio recording that may be produced.</p>
