<p>In regards to our 2005 BBQ being held at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2351+S+900+E+84106&hl=en">Fairmont Park</a> on August the 12th at 6:00pm (we'll fire up the BBQ around 7:00), please RSVP to Mac Newbold (contact information on the mailing list) and let him know what dish you plan on bringing down with you so we can make sure we're not top heavy with any one food. Dave seems to be a hard man to get a hold of, so it doesn't look like I'll have the chance to try some of his homemade root beer, however, Josh "dataw0lf" Simpson has volunteered to take care of drinks for us.</p>
<p>It's right by the 700 E exit of I-80. If you're coming from I-15, you'll get off at 700 East, take a left (under the overpass) and turn right at the first street (Ashton Ave.). You'll go two blocks, and then go across 900 E right into the parking lot of Fairmont Park. We have the Main Grove Bowery reserved from 6pm-10pm, which is just directly east of the parking lot on the other side of the skate park. There's plenty at the park for the whole family. If you'd like to bring a frisbee, football, soccer ball, horseshoes, or something else, they'll probably get used.</p>
