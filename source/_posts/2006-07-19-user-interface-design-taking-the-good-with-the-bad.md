<p>Digital Web Magazine published an excellent <a href="http://digital-web.com/articles/user_interface_design_taking_the_good_with_the_bad/">article</a> yesterday by <a href="http://www.webanza.com/">Mike Padilla</a> on user interface design. I would recommend this read to everyone involved in application development, even if you are not a designer. Marketers, engineers, salesmen, and administrators could all benefit from understanding the complexity of designing interfaces and the blancing act required when choosing between costs and benefits. <em>"When evaluating the net usability of one design versus another, a logical process should be followed to effectively evaluate the compromises that accompany each. To judge the good with the bad, you need a UI ruler by which to measure."</em></p>
