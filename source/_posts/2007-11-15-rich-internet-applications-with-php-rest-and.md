<p>For our November meeting,  Alvaro Carrasco will be presenting on Building Rich Internet Applications with PHP, REST and ExtJS.</p>
<p>Rich Internet Applications, or RIA for short, are applications that are still web based, but that have interaction with servers.  These applications are built with special attention to human interaction, that is, they feel like desktop applications.  Having attended a previous presentation from Alvaro, I can honestly say that he is a master at this.</p>
<p>About the presentation, Alvaro says the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Building Rich Internet Applications with PHP, REST, and ExtJs. ExtJs is an extremely powerful UI toolkit for the web. It lets us create incredible desktop-like GUIs that work flawlessly on IE, Firefox, Safari, and Opera without the need of plugins, just pure Javascript and CSS. It doesn't depend on any specific server-side technology either, just a way to communicate with the server (XML, JSON, etc). Since we all enjoy writing PHP, we can use it to perform the actual work and communicate to the GUI using REST services. This combination of technologies makes writing cool web applications a joy. And of course, it's all open source.</p></blockquote>
<p>This presentation will be broadcast as usual, please go to 76.8.222.140 on Thursday @7p to hear.  Questions through IRC.</p>
