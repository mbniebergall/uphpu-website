  content: 'Where in NC are you? Here''s a site I found googling: http://php.meetup.com/cities/us/nc/durham/
    . You can change the city to where you are. It may not show all of them, but it

<p>Last October I had an opportunity to take my consulting company from just a small part time gig to a full time company. The downside is in doing this it moved me to North Carolina. So the reason for this post and how it pertains. I really enjoy being part of this group for the many years that I have been. However I am now attempting to locate groups like this in North Carolina. Anyone have any ideas of good places to look for groups like this in a new area, or even have suggestions on how I could start a similar group to this here in North Carolina?</p>
