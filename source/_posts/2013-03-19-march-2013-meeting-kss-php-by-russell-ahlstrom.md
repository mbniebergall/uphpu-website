<p>We have an excellent presentation for this Thursday's meeting by Russell Ahlstrom: KSS &amp; PHP.</p>
<blockquote><p>KSS is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as SCSS or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).</p>
<p>KSS-PHP is a php library that you can use to turn your KSS documented files into a living styleguide similar to Github's (<a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css">https://github.com/styleguide/css</a>). Styleguides are helpful for maintaining consistency across your sites, getting new developers up to speed, proving out new designs or additions, and ensuring changes or updates to your css don't break existing styles.</p>
<p>Russell is the Director of Web Development for Scan, a Provo based startup that connects the real world with the digital universe in fun and innovative ways. Previous to that, Russell worked as the Director of eCommerce Development at Deseret Digital Media, Senior Developer at Bloosky, Team Lead at BYU's Department of Continuing Education, and as a Web Development instructor at BYU.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our meeting will be held at 7:00PM at the Vinit Office's in Thanksgiving Point, and theÂ after partyÂ will be at Applebee's in Draper as usual. At this meeting we will be discussing venues as well.</p>
<p><strong>Directions To Current Venue: Vivint Offices in Thanksgiving Point</strong></p>
<p>For this meeting we will be meeting at the ThanksgivingÂ Point Vivint Offices, which is just one more exit south than our previous venue. Here is the address:</p>
<p>2500 Executive Pkwy #200, Lehi, Utah 84043</p>
<p>Here is a link in Google Maps:</p>

<p>Here are the directions given by our very own Mac Newbold:</p>
<blockquote><p>Easiest way: get off I-15 at Timpanogos Highway (SR-92) and head west (right if you're coming from Draper, left if you came north through Lehi)</p>
<p>the next light in about a block is Ashton Blvd/Maple Loop - turn left and about 3-4 blocks later, after the in-construction building, there's a road on the left right before the thanksgiving point complex starts,</p>
<p>that's executive parkway</p>
<p>you'll turn left there and we're the building on the left that is finished</p>
<p>come on in, 2nd floor</p></blockquote>
<p>Look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night at 7:00 PM! Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions!</p>
