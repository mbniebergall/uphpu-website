<p>For our February <a href="/events/">meeting</a>, <a href="http://josephscott.org">Joseph Scott</a>, Bug Exorcist for Automattic, will be presenting on <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/">WordPress APIs</a>, XML-RPC & <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/rfc5023.html">AtomPub</a>.</p>
<p>Joseph will be presenting on WordPress APIs, XML-RPC & AtomPub.  WordPress has two sets of APIs available for third party clients, XML-RPC and AtomPub.  We'll cover the background and details about both, how OAuth may fit in the future and then dive into PHP examples of how to use XML-RPC to manage your WordPress blog.</p>
<p>Joseph is a California native, living in Utah with his wife and two daughters. He got hooked on email when it meant dialing into a BBS with a 2400 baud modem and ended up memorizing way too much of the AT command set. Access to the Internet changed all that and going to work for an ISP cemented that shift. It also exposed to him to the world of open source, starting with FreeBSD in 1996. From there he spent a number of years in IT doing a little bit of everything.</p>
