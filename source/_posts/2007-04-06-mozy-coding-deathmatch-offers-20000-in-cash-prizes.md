<p>Berkeley Data Systems, creators of Mozy Online Backup, will be holding its second semiannual <a href="http://mozy.com/contest/rules">coding deathmatch</a> on Saturday, April 14. Billed as a "thinly disguised recruiting effort to find the best local engineers," the competition is open to all Utah residents.</p>
<p>The previous deathmatch saw over 100 participants and was a success both for the 8 finalists who received prize money, and for BDS who hired 4 new engineers in the process.</p>
