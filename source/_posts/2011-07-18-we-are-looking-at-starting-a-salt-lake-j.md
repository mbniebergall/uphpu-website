<p>We are looking at starting a Salt Lake Javascript Users group and thought the PHP community might be interested. We are thinking about meeting in the downtown area on the first Thursday of every month. Come let us know if you would be interested in joining us. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ujsug</p>
