  content: It will be a different chapter, but we will all be in the same group (if
    that makes sense). We will be on the same website. There seemed to be enough interest
    in having a meeting in salt lake. It looks like we will be moving to the second
    or 4th Thursday so as not to conflict with the Utah County meeting.

  content: I'd be quite interested in attending a Salt Lake based group. As long at
    it's Thursday after about 06:30 or so, the time sounds good as well.

<p>We are looking at starting a Salt Lake Javascript Users group and thought the PHP community might be interested. We are thinking about meeting in the downtown area on the first Thursday of every month. Come let us know if you would be interested in joining us. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ujsug</p>
