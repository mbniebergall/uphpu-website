<p>For our November <a href="/about/meetings/">meeting</a>, <a href="/author/mac/">Mac Newbold</a> will present on Database design. He'll be discussing Entity-Relationship Diagrams/modeling, the various Normal Forms for normalizing your database, and how to translate those to a relational database implementation. Then he'll talk about performance and optimization, keys/indices, and a bit about data warehousing. He'll be going over some real examples supplied by whoever is there tonight, so come with some ideas!</p>
