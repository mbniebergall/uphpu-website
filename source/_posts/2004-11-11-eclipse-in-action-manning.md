<p>I reviewed Eclipse In Action to familiarize myself with the IDE Eclipse.  My main focus while reading the book was to learn all I can about developing with Eclipse. I wanted to be able to utilize all the features that Eclipse has to offer, not only in terms of Java developer, but also as a web developer. However, I want to point out that this book is "A Guide for Java Developers"?. So the target audience is for a Java Developer.</p>
<p>The book starts out with a great introduction into Eclipse and the how the IDE comes together in the workbench.  Then it moves right into the Java development with Eclipse. It wastes no time getting to the meat of development with Junit, Log4j, testing, debugging, and Ant integration.  Not to mention a chapter on CVS integration.  The book has everything that a developer needs during the development life cycle of their project.  The authors do a great job in adding additional information on the features that Eclipse has to offer to help alleviate the remedial tasks during development.  Many of these features can be used outside of Java development.</p>
<p>Part 2 of Eclipse In Action deals with extending Eclipse and creating Eclipse plugins (the foundation of Eclipse).  These chapters give a great novice introduction into Eclipse plugin development; however, there seems to be lacking detail into SWT/JFace and advanced plugin development.</p>
<p>Overall Eclipse In Action provides an indepth look into the Eclipse IDE. I would recommend this book to anyone that want to use Eclipse as their IDE. I have been using Eclipse for over a year now and I use it for all languages I develop with, like Java and PHP.  Though the book focuses on the Java Developer, this also lends it way into development with other languages.</p>
