<p>This Thursdayâ€™s UPHPU meeting will be presented by Bryan Petty: <a href="http://svnlogbrowser.org/">svnLogBrowser</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation is on svnLogBrowser which provides a web-based frontend for browsing through commit logs from any Subversion repository, and is released under the GNU GPL. It gives developers a tool for quickly locating changes, reviewing peer developer's commits, or just a general overview of what recent changes have been made to a project.</p>
<p>The lecture will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>install/config (brief)</li>
<li>techniques for searching and watching commits</li>
</ul>
<p>Bryan is a long time member of UPHPU who has worked on several well known projects including svnLogBrowser, wxWidgets development, and work on Phoenix Project Manager.  He has also gone the past 7 years to volunteer at Defcon.</p>
