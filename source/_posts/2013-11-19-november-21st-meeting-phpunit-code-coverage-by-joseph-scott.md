<p>This month's presentation will be by Joseph Scott on "PHPUnit Code Coverage". It will be on November 21st at Needle.com at 7:00 PM and then we'll be meeting at Applebees in Draper for the after-party.</p>
<p>Talk Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>
You've been writing unit tests for your PHP code, but how sure are you that they cover every line of code.  We'll go over generating code coverage analysis reports using PHPUnit so that you can see exactly how much of your code your unit tests cover.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Joseph is the team lead for VaultPress, a WordPress backup and security service by Automattic. </p>
