<p>I'm converting video for HTML5. I've been using <a href="http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/">Miro Video Converter</a>. It's works great, except that the OGV files it produces aren't working in Firefox. I'm not sure if it's a weakness with the converter or the source file (I'm converting FLVs). I tried <a href="http://www.firefogg.org/">FireFogg</a> and the file it produced works and, interestingly, is half the size.</p>
