<p>It has been several years that I have been looing for an adequate solution to the task of giving a user non-shell, chrooted, secure server access. I finally found that in an small application called <a href="http://www.sublimation.org/scponly/">scponly</a>. It was simple to <a>install</a>, easy to configure and use, and got the job done beautifully. A script is even provided for setting up accounts, assisting you in configuring all the options. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a similar solution.</p>
