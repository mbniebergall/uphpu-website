<p>We provide several mediums for engaging in discussions and encourage participation through each as they offer unique ways for expressing oneself and interacting with other members. We recommend approaching the group in the following manner: post ideas, articles, and thoughts to the discussion board; post questions to the mailing list; and converse about anything in our irc channel. Please review our <a href="/mailing-lists-and-irc/policies/">policies</a> before participating.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to join the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/25209/46099C1DE7D1">UPHPU LinkedIn Group</a>.</p>
<h2>discsussion board</h2>
<p>The discussion board allows users to post messages on the website and to leave comments to messages from others. You must be logged in to post. <strong>Compose a message on the <a href="http://uphpu.org/contribute/">contribute page</a></strong>. Leave replies to posts via the form below each post.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="/archives/">archives</a> to browse past posts.</p>
<h2>mailing lists</h2>
<p>A mailing list works by many people being subscribed to a list mail serer and email messages sent to a single address are delivered to all subscribers. Usually, one person posts a question or thought and others respond. Each set of related posts are called threads. Some email readers will display these threads in a unique fashion such that replies appear indented under the original message.</p>
