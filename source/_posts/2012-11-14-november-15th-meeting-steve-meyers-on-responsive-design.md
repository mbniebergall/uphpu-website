<p>Have you ever wondered how some sites seem to magically work perfectly on any size browser window, any size screen, any device you use to access it? It's called Responsive Design, and Steve Meyers is going to show you how to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Thursday, November 15th, 7pm at C7 Bluffdale Data Center. See you there!</p>
