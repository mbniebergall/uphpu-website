<p>Greets All,</p>
<p> We are postponing our August meeting for one month so that we can focus on the Utah Open Source Conference on August 28 &ndash; 30.  This year's conference topics look really solid with many national and community level speakers including:</p>
<p>-	Paul Frields (Red hat, Inc) - KEYNOTE: Fedora: The Future, First<br />
-	Joe Brockmeier (Novell) - KEYNOTE: How to bootstrap a community<br />
-	Matt Asay (Alfresco) - The Billion Dollar (Free) Software Opportunity<br />
-	Mac Newbold (Code Greene) - Local Keynote: How To Leverage Open Source in a For-Profit Business<br />
-	Jared Smith ( co-author of  O'Reilly's Asterisk: The Future of Telephony) - Dialplans for Dummies: An Introduction to the Asterisk Dialplan<br />
-	Joseph Scott (Automattic) -  WordPress Performance and Scalability</p>
<p>These are literally, just a handful of an awesome lineup of speakers.  Having participated last year and this year, I can tell you Clint Savage and the UTOS foundation spend a lot of time getting this conference up and running right.  I strongly recommend if you have time to attend some or all the days that you take advantage.</p>
