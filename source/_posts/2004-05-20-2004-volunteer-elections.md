<p>We are currently accepting nomincations for our 2004 group volunteers. The following positions are available... </p>
<ul>
<li>user accounts manager</li>
<li>mailing list manager</li>
<li>event manager</li>
<li>librarian (already filled: Ray Hunter)</li>
<li>webmaster</li>
</ul>
<p>We will begin the elections with nominations. If you are the only one that volunteers for a position, then the position is yours (assuming that you have the technical skills necessary to fulfill the required responsibilities); otherwise the candidates will be put to vote by the group. </p>
<p>Nominations for the remainder of the 2004 year will run from Wednesday, 19 May 2004, until midnight Saturday, 22 May 2004. Please email your nominations to "admin@uphpu.org." </p>
<p>2004 officer elections (if necessary) will then be held from Sunday, 23 May 2004 until midnight, Wednesday, 26 May 2004, through the website. </p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from everyone and encourage you to volunteer. We appreciate the support and service that is being offered by our members and look forward to expanding opportunities to the rest of the group.</p>
