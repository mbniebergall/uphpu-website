<p>For our August meeting, Richard Miller will present on internationalization and localization. We'll discuss character sets and encodings, internationalization/localization (i18n/l10n), how to use PHP and MySQL with foreign characters, and how to use the GNU gettext package for internationalizing your web app.</p>
