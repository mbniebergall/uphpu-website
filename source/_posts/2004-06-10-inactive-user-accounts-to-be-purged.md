<p>Pardon a small note regarding user accounts on our website. We have a handful of accounts that appear to be inactive. The user has never logged in and (therefore) has not personalized their profile. We imagine that a few of these could be users that made a error when registering and left an artifact when re-registering, since the ability to delete one's account was not originally available. We also were not originally moderating the registration process and suspect that a few accounts might be from the bots that left us the poetry last week.</p>
<p>To assist us in verifying active accounts, we would like to ask each user that has not logged in since registering or has not added their full name to your profile, to please take a moment to log in and do such. If these inactive accounts remain unused they will be purged.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. We hope that you are finding the website useful.</p>
