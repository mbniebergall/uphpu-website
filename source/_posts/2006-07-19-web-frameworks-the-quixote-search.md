<p>In a recent entry in his blog, John Taber, reviews his <a href="//www.johntaber.com/?p=10">search for a good web framework</a>. <em>"In converting some software from java and c++ to web based systems, our first step was to choose a coding platform.  Note I didn't say language or framework or IDE&mdash;today it's more of a package deal where one part depends on another. Today the clamor and hype is over frameworks.  But in our case, we choose to cut through all that and ask: Is a "framework" needed?  What is the right structure for a web based program?  And what is the most productive, agile way we can get the job done?"</em></p>
