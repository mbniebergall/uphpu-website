<p>For our November meeting, <a href="/users.php?mode=profile&uid=14">Mac Newbold</a> presented on arrays. A fun-filled evening of exciting adventures was had with everyone's favorite PHP data type. We covered both lists and associative arrays, the differences between them, and their respective operators and functions. We demonstrated how to use them in various loop constructs, and a million and one ways to sort your arrays. We showed everyone how to use arrays in some of the other standard PHP functions, like the string functions. And finally, we covered how to use arrays to make advanced data structures, like multi-dimentional arrays, lists of lists, and "structs" or mock objects.</p>
