<p>With the anticipated upgrade of a new server and the hope that we can continue to increase our range of resources and usefulness, we would also like to poll our members regarding additional features and tools that may be of use to them. A few have mentioned bulletin boards in the past, paste bins, php.net mirrors, project archives among other things. What about services such as our library and the relationships that we have with publishers? What about our monthly presentations? audio and video? streaming? We have also talked repeatedly over the years about collaborating on a project. Is there still interest in that? Who's willing? (Post your name and level of interest as a comment to this article.) What would you be interested in working on? Even if it's far fetched, we would love to know what you are interested in or what could help you.</p>
