  content: "I have read this book, and taken a couple of the Zend PHP5 *prectice*
    exams, getting ready for the official PHP5 certification. When reading the book,
    I was happy with it. I, like Jon, found it worthy of reading. It did highlight
    an area or two that I, being a self taught software developer, knew that I needed
    work.\r\n\r\nThe pitfall to this book is that, even though it touts its self as
    *the* prep guide for the Zend certification, it seriously lacks a lot of the info
    needed to actually pass the test. If you are using it as *the* study guide, I
    would emphasize getting another book or two to complete your studying.\r\n\r\nIn
    the interest of full disclosure, I have not yet taken the actual Zend PHP5 certification
    test, but I have taken 2 of the official *practice* tests and, even though I passed
    them both, I know that I wouldn't have if I had only relied on this one book.
    I believe that my 10+ years of programming, in conjunction with this, and other
    books, were the reason I passed.\r\n\r\nWhat the book is good for is letting you
    see inside the mind of the test, to some degree. Giving you a feel for the various
    topics that the questions will revolve around."

<p>I recently picked up a copy of the "<a href="http://www.phparch.com/shop_product.php?itemid=135">ZEND PHP 5 Certification Study Guide</a>" by <a href="http://phparch.com/">php|architect</a>.  I have not yet finished it, however thus far I have liked it enough to want to tell other people about it.</p>
<p>The book is around 250 pages long (short by most standards).  To this point I have found that this book is a good way to brush up on things I already knew and learn some things that I did not.  I am personally using the book to help me study for the <a href="http://www.zend.com/education/zend_php_certification">PHP 5 certification</a>.  However, certification or not, it is turning out to be an excellent tool for honing my skills.  It has the added benefit of showing me areas that I need to work on as well as indicating to myself how much about PHP I really know.</p>
<p>I would recommend this book to the PHP programmer of any level.</p>
