<p>A <a href="http://aaronbarkerphotography.com/">friend</a> told me about <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a> yesterday. Steve works at Google and is the author of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow">YSlow</a>, the performance analysis extension to Firebug. My friend pointed me to a list of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">performance "rules"</a> that Steve published and to a <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajax-experience-videos-performance-and-security">talk that he gave</a> (first one on the page) recently at a conference. If you are interested in web performance, this checklist and talk are not to be missed.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest things that I learned was to not use "@import" to link to style sheets and how to download javascript scripts in parallel.</p>
