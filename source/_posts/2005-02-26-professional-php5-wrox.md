<p>This is an awesome book that I would highly recommend. I am the type of person who learns well by considering how things fit into the big picture. <em>Professional PHP5</em> really does a great job of describing the issues of PHP software design in its most structured forms.</p>
<p><em>Professional PHP5</em> starts with PHP5 Object Orientation Programming (OOP) concepts and moves into the ideas of broad patterns and toolkits. They provide code you can tryout yourself; doing is of course the best way to learn.</p>
<p>You can build a tool kit with useful collection classes, generic object classes, communication classes, debugging classes, and abstract classes. You can learn the practical and ideal implementations of a Model View Controller pattern and Unit Testing. You can get a feel for SOAP, the finite state machine, and PHP session handling.</p>
<p>The book also has great tips and examples of project management, system design and planning, quality testing, and deployment.</p>
<p>It is a really great book for a wide audience, and I'd recommend it for serious PHP programmers.</p>
