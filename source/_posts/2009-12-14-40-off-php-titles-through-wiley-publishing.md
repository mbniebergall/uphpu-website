  content: Thanks Wade, you are the man. I have been a member here at uphpu for a
    while, but I haven't been an active member. I always have watched job postings
    come through, and when the day came that I decided to go corporate, I applied
    to one of the job postings and got the job. I want to become more active in UPHPU
    as a way of saying thank you. Let me know if there is anything I can help with.
