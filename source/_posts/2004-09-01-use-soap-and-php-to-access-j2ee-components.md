<p>Olexiy Prohorenko looks at a software project with a PHP front end and a Java based back end. In <a href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/21707">Use SOAP to Access EJB Components with PHP</a> he shows how to expose your EJB components as web services. He takes a stateless session bean, deployes it as a web service using SOAP, and then modifies the PHP front end to use this web service.</p>
