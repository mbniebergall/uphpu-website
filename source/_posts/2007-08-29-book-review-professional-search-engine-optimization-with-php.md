<p>As part of my research for last Thursday's <a href="http://uphpu.org/2007/08/16/search-engine-optimization-and-php/">UPHPU meeting about search engine optimization</a>, I reviewed a new book:Â  <strong>Professional Search Engine Optimization with PHP: A Developer's Guide to SEO</strong>  by Jaimie Sirovich, Cristian Darie, published in April 2007 by Wrox. In my opinion, SEO should be a part of every developer's training. The book covers all the basics, debunks a few myths, advises on how to avoid black hat SEO attacks, talks about foreign language SEO, and rounds out with chapters including an e-commerce case study and SEO for WordPress.</p>
