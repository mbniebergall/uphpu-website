<p>Center 7, a gracious sponsor for several years has offered to bring us back home to the old Linux Networx building in Bluffdale. Center 7 purchased the building recently and added it to their list of data centers along the Wasatch Front. You might have read in the news a few months back about Twitter hosting their service (at least in part) from there. Feedback indicates that the location is more convenient for most of the group.</p>
