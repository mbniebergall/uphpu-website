<p>For our November meeting, <a href="http://novapages.com">Velda Harper Christensen</a> will present on fundamental concepts that won't replace your designer, but will help bridge the gap between logic and aesthetics. Velda is a designer, blogger, mother, geek, and full-time student. As usually, after hours party to follow!</p>
<p>We are also running a tech book drive to assist those who are just starting to learn web programming!  You and I both know you're not using those HTML books anymore!  bring them in and let somebody else benefit from something collecting dust on your shelf! Bring in what you can, HTML, JavaScript, etc,  I promise it'll go to good use.</p>
