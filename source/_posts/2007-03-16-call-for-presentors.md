<p>It's time to fill the <a href="/about/meetings/">calendar</a> again! We have reached the end of our list of scheduled presentations and thus are calling out for volunteers to pick their topic and date. Browse the past thirty-nine <a href="/category/presentations">presentations</a> for a review of previews topics and for ideas.</p>
<p>Picking one more than a year old is fine (as we have many new members and those that have been around a while could use the review) and can cover anything related to PHP, programming, databases, and general web development. Presenters can be anyoneâ€”member or not and qualified or notâ€”that desires to prepare some thoughts/examples on a topic or simply lead a discussion.</p>
<p>We meet on the third Thursday of each month in a conference room with whiteboards and a projector. Post a comment to this post to volunteer and get your name on the calendar.</p>
