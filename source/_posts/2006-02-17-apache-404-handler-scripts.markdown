<p><a href="/users.php?mode=profile&uid=14">Mac Newbold</a> presented on PHP 404 handler scripts. "Running PHP with Apache has some definite advantages. One that I use frequently is using a PHP script as the 404 document that apache uses when a page can't be found. You can use it for many things. PHP.net uses it to run a site search, to try and find the page you were looking for. You can use it to create 'virtual' URLs, where one script handles requests for many different URLs and hands back dynamic content based on the page name. You can even combine it with things like GD to make dynamic images that are created on the fly for each URL."</p>
