<p>We're pleased to annouce that for FebruaryÂ we will have a presentation by Jon St. John, Director of Engineering for Drive Current. It will be this Thursday (February 21st, 2013) at 7:00 PM.Â <em><strong>We have also changed venues this year! So please check the details below!Â </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Presentation on Selenium</strong></p>
<p>Jon will be presenting on Selenium, a tool for automating tests of websites. From Seleium's website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Selenium automates browsers. That's it. What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.</p>
<p>Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Current Venue: Vivint Offices in Thanksgiving Point</strong></p>
<p>For this meeting we will be meeting at ThanksgivingÂ Point Vivint Offices, which is just one more exit south than our previous venue. Here is the address:</p>
<p>2500 Executive Pkwy #200, Lehi, Utah 84043</p>
<p>Here is a link in Google Maps:</p>

<p>Here are the directions given by our very own Mac Newbold:</p>
<blockquote><p>Easiest way: get off I-15 at Timpanogos Highway (SR-92) and head west (right if you're coming from Draper, left if you came north through Lehi)</p>
<p>the next light in about a block is Ashton Blvd/Maple Loop - turn left and about 3-4 blocks later, after the in-construction building, there's a road on the left right before the thanksgiving point complex starts,</p>
<p>that's executive parkway</p>
<p>you'll turn left there and we're the building on the left that is finished</p>
<p>come on in, 2nd floor</p></blockquote>
<p>Look forward to seeing everyone Thursday night at 7:00 PM! Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any questions!</p>
