<p>I have just posted the presentation from last nights UPHPU meeting at http://utahcon.com/presentations/php_fundamentals.odp</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that came out last night, I really enjoyed the chance to hopefully impart some best practices on each of you. I know I learned a few things along the way too!</p>
