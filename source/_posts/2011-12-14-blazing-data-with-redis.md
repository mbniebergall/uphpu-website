<p>For our December <a href="/events">meeting</a>, Justin Carmony will present on "Blazing Data with Redis." There are several solutions about in the "NoSQL" realm, and I'll be honest, Redis is one of my favorites. Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.</p>
<p>What is great about Redis is just how fast it is. In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.</p>
<p>So come down and learn the basics of Redis, whether using it as an advanced cache alternative to Memcached, a queueing system, a data store, or anything where you would benefit from high performance reads and writes.</p>
